We will examine scientific method steps in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of
hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. Ahypothesisis a suggested explanation for an event, which one can test.
Although using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because it is
relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like
archaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as repeating experiments becomes more
difficult.
These areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archaeology—even though one cannot perform repeatable
experiments, hypotheses may still be supported. For instance, an archaeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed
based on finding a piece of pottery. He or she could make further hypotheses about various characteristics of this culture, which
could be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified
theory. Atheoryis a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Therefore, we may be better off to define
science as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.
Natural Sciences
What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the brain
functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy,
biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure 1.4). However, scientists consider those
fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processesnatural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural
sciences might contain any of the items listed above.
Figure1.4The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, mathematics,
and many other fields. (credit: “Image Editor”/Flickr)
There is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. For some experts, the
natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences
intolife sciences, which study living things and include biology, andphysical sciences, which study nonliving matter and
include astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life
and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Some refer to natural sciences as “hard science” because they rely on the use of

• The Science of Biology 11
Figure1.5Historians credit Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) as the first to define the scientific method. (credit: Paul van Somer)
The scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to solve) that leads to a question. Let’s think about a
simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a
student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a
problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why is the classroom so warm?”
Proposing a Hypothesis
Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that one can test. To solve a problem, one can propose several hypotheses. For
example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.” However, there
could be other responses to the question, and therefore one may propose other hypotheses. A second hypothesis might be, “The
classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn’t work.”
Once one has selected a hypothesis, the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has
the format “If . . . then . . . .” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “Ifthe student turns on the air
conditioning,thenthe classroom will no longer be too warm.”
Testing a Hypothesis
A valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also befalsifiable, meaning that experimental results can disprove it. Importantly,
science does not claim to “prove” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further
information. This step—openness to disproving ideas—is what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. The presence of the
supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more
experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or
more controls. Avariableis any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. Thecontrol group
contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that the researcher hypothesizes.
Therefore, if the experimental group's results differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized
manipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow. To test the first
hypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there
should be another reason, and the student should reject this hypothesis. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check
if the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and the student should reject this hypothesis. The
students should test each hypothesis by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not
determine whether or not one can accept the other hypotheses. It simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (Figure 1.6).
Using the scientific method, the student rejects the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data.
While this “warm classroom” example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer
controls. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. One

VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure1.7Scientists use two types of reasoning, inductive and deductive reasoning, to advance scientific knowledge. As is the case in this
example, the conclusion from inductive reasoning can often become the premise for deductive reasoning.
Decide if each of the following is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.
1. All flying birds and insects have wings. Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air. Therefore, wings
enable flight.
2. Insects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones. Therefore, insect pests will become more problematic if
global temperatures increase.
3. Chromosomes, the carriers of DNA, are distributed evenly between the daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, each
daughter cell will have the same chromosome set as the mother cell.
4. Animals as diverse as humans, insects, and wolves all exhibit social behavior. Therefore, social behavior must have an
evolutionary advantage.
The scientific method may seem too rigid and structured. It is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often follow
this sequence, there is flexibility. Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach. Often, an

individual’s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) Researchers have studied other less complex organisms as part of
this project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on
basic research with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the
data for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.
Figure1.9The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different science fields.
Researchers completed the project, which sequenced the entire human genome, in 2003. (credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome
Programs (http://genomics.energy.gov(http://openstax.org/l/genomics_gov))
While scientists usually carefully plan research efforts in both basic science and applied science, note that some discoveries are
made byserendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin when he accidentally left a petri dish ofStaphylococcusbacteria open. An unwanted mold grew on the dish,
killing the bacteria. Fleming's curiosity to investigate the reason behind the bacterial death, followed by his experiments, led to
the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin, which is produced by the fungusPenicillium. Even in the highly organized world of
science, luck—when combined with an observant, curious mind—can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.
Reporting Scientific Work
Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers
to expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists—when planning, conducting, and analyzing
results—are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist’s work are communicating
with peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or
conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in
peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals.Peer-reviewed manuscriptsare scientific papers that a
scientist’s colleagues or peers review. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who
judge whether or not the scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research
in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for
research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their
experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with
the findings of other scientists.
A scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed
guidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate. A
scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.
The scientific paper consists of several specific sections—introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. This
structure is sometimes called the “IMRaD” format. There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an
abstract(a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper

Themes and Concepts of Biology
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify and describe the properties of life
• Describe the levels of organization among living things
• Recognize and interpret a phylogenetic tree
• List examples of different subdisciplines in biology
Biology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but
it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the
characteristics of living entities but lack others. Although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even
reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly
speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life. Since the events that preceded life
are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.
From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something
“alive”? Once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? Finally, when faced
with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand
them? As scientists discover new organisms every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.
Properties of Life
All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment,
reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When viewed
together, these eight characteristics serve to define life.

Order
Figure1.10A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. (credit:
“Ivengo”/Wikimedia Commons)
Organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled
organisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms comprise molecules. These in turn comprise cell organelles and other
cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (Figure 1.10), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create
organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.
Sensitivity or Response to Stimuli
Figure1.11The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. After a few minutes, the plant
returns to normal. (credit: Alex Lomas)
Organisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or
respond to touch (Figure 1.11). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process calledchemotaxis) or light
(phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is a negative response.
LINK TO LEARNING
Watchthis video(http://openstax.org/l/movement_plants)to see how plants respond to a stimulus—from opening to light, to
wrapping a tendril around a branch, to capturing prey.
Reproduction
Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to
form two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline, gamete, oocyte, and sperm cells.
After fertilization (the fusion of an oocyte and a sperm cell), a new individual develops. When reproduction occurs, DNA

maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, throughhomeostasis
(literally, “steady state”). For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through the thermoregulation process.
Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.13), have body structures that help them withstand low
temperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot
climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.
Energy Processing
Figure1.14The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) uses chemical energy derived from food to power flight. California condors
are an endangered species. This bird has a wing tag that helps biologists identify the individual. (credit: Pacific Southwest Region U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service)
All organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert it
into chemical energy in food. Others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (Figure 1.14).
Evolution
The diversity of life on Earth is a result of mutations, or random changes in hereditary material over time. These mutations allow
the possibility for organisms to adapt to a changing environment. An organism that evolves characteristics fit for the
environment will have greater reproductive success, subject to the forces of natural selection.
Levels of Organization of Living Things
Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that we can examine on a scale from small to large. The
atomis the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form
molecules. Amoleculeis a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds.
Many molecules that are biologically important aremacromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by
polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than
macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.15), which contains the instructions
for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.

Biologists collectively call all the individuals of a species living within a specific area apopulation. For example, a forest may
include many pine trees, which represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same
specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants, insects, and microbial
populations. Acommunityis the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects,
and other populations in a forest form the forest’s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. Anecosystemconsists of all the
living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, nonliving parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or
rain water. At the highest level of organization (Figure 1.16), thebiosphereis the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents
the zones of life on Earth. It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.

The scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines. Biologists may pursue one of those
subdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance,molecular biologyandbiochemistrystudy biological processes at
the molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way
they are regulated.Microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled
organisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists,
ecologists, and geneticists, among others.

Forensic Scientist
Forensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists and
biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves
examining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly
because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, developing molecular techniques and
establishing DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily
related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood,
and other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.19) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic
scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to
pursue careers in forensic science will most likely have to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math
courses.

the conversion of these to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—is a series of
chemical reactions that follow chemical laws. The properties of water and the formation of hydrogen
bonds are key to understanding living processes. Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is

## Section 63.1
Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The
Building Blocks
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define matter and elements
• Describe the interrelationship between protons, neutrons, and electrons
• Compare the ways in which electrons can be donated or shared between atoms
• Explain the ways in which naturally occurring elements combine to create molecules, cells,
tissues, organ systems, and organisms
At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter.Matteris any substance that occupies space and has
mass.Elementsare unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot break
down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions. There are 118 elements, but only 98 occur
naturally. The remaining elements are unstable and require scientists to synthesize them in laboratories.
Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is
already “taken” by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for
the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements’ chemical symbols derive from their
Latin names. For example, the symbol for sodium is Na, referring tonatrium, the Latin word for sodium.
The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen
(N). In the nonliving world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to
living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole, asTable 2.1shows. For example, the atmosphere
is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth’s crust, although it
contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon. In spite of their differences
in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical
laws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or nonliving world.
Approximate Percentage of Elements in Living Organisms (Humans) Compared to the Nonliving World

Oxygen (O) 65% 21% 46%
Carbon (C) 18% trace trace
Hydrogen (H) 10% trace 0.1%
Nitrogen (N) 3% 78% trace
Table2.1
The Structure of the Atom
To understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the element's smallest component or
building block, the atom. Anatomis the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the element's chemical
properties. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room
temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and
contains small amounts of other elements known as impurities. We cannot break down gold atoms into
anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.
An atom is composed of two regions: thenucleus, which is in the atom's center and contains protons and
neutrons. The atom's outermost region holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, asFigure 2.2
illustrates. Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only
exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.

Figure2.2Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the
nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.
Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10-24grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of
mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, asTable 2.2shows. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in
their electric charge. Aprotonis positively charged; whereas, aneutronis uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an
atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge.Electronsare much smaller in mass than protons, weighing
only 9.11 × 10-28grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element’s overall
atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the
atom’s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do
contribute greatly to the atom’s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the proton's positive charge. In
uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In
these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.
Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the atom's volume—greater than 99 percent—is empty
space. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they
do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.
Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons
Charge Mass (amu) Location
Proton +1 1 nucleus
Neutron 0 1 nucleus
Electron –1 0 orbitals
Table2.2
Atomic Number and Mass
Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an
element’satomic number, which scientists use to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable,
resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess.
Together, the number of protons and neutrons determine an element’smass number, asFigure 2.3illustrates. Note that we
disregard the small contribution of mass from electrons in calculating the mass number. We can use this approximation of mass
to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number.
Since an element’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine theatomic mass, which is the
calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For
example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with
atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).

The Periodic Table
Theperiodic tableorganizes and displays different elements. Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) in 1869,
the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements. The properties of
elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. Elements also have
specificchemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.
In the periodic table inFigure 2.5, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged
in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing the atomic number
for each element, the periodic table also displays the element’s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (C) and
name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.01.

Figure2.6In 1913, Niels Bohrs developed the Bohr model in which electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists in
the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy
shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, it releases a photon of light.
Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of
increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they fill with one electron in each
energy level before adding a second electron. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the atom's energetic stability
and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.
Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost
shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight
electrons. This is known as theoctet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable
energetically when they have eight electrons in theirvalence shell, the outermost electron shell.Figure 2.7shows examples of
some neutral atoms and their electron configurations. Notice that inFigure 2.7, helium has a complete outer electron shell, with
two electrons filling its first and only shell. Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons. In contrast,
chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but theoretically they would be more energetically
stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.

Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom’s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each
subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly an electron's location,
scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. The letter s,p,d, andfdesignate the subshells. Thes
subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a singlesorbital, which can hold two electrons.
Principal shell 2n has onesand onepsubshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. Thepsubshell has three dumbbell-shaped
orbitals, asFigure 2.8illustrates. Subshellsdandfhave more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively.
We do not show these in the illustration. Principal shell 3n hass,p, anddsubshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n
hass,p,dandforbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals in the
energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, we can determine the electron structure by
fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.
Figure2.8Thessubshells are shaped like spheres. Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have ansorbital, but the size of the sphere is larger
in the 2n orbital. Each sphere is a single orbital. Three dumbbell-shaped orbitals comprisepsubshells. Principal shell 2n has apsubshell,
but shell 1 does not.
The closest orbital to the nucleus, the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the Bohr model's
innermost electron shell. Scientists call it the 1sorbital because it is spherical around the nucleus. The 1sorbital is the closest
orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital fills. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it occupies
only one spot within the 1sorbital. We designate this as 1s1, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s
orbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1sorbital with its two electrons. We designate this as 1s2,
referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1sorbital. On the periodic tableFigure 2.5, hydrogen and helium are the only two
elements in the first row (period). This is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1sorbital. Hydrogen and helium
are the only two elements that have the 1sand no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.
The second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another sphericalsorbital and three “dumbbell”
shapedporbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, asFigure 2.8shows. After the 1sorbital fills, the second electron shell
fills, first filling its 2sorbital and then its threeporbitals. When filling theporbitals, each takes a single electron. Once eachp
orbital has an electron, it may add a second. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells. Two
electrons fill the 1sorbital, and the third electron then fills the 2sorbital. Itselectron configurationis 1s22s1. Neon (Ne),
alternatively, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1sorbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2sand
threeporbitals). Thus it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other
atoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, comprising the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and
orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of an atom's electron configuration because the orbital

Figure2.10A double bond joins the oxygen atoms in an O2molecule.
Some chemical reactions, such as the one above, can proceed in one direction until they expend all the reactants. The equations
that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and areirreversible.Reversible reactionsare those that can go in
either direction. In reversible reactions, reactants turn into products, but when the product's concentration goes beyond a
certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products convert back into reactants. At this point,
product and reactant designations reverse. This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and
products occurs—a state calledequilibrium. A chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the
reactants and products often denote these reversible reaction situations.
For example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H+) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO-) forming an equilibrium state with
3
carbonic acid (H CO). If we added carbonic acid to this system, some of it would convert to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.
2 3
However, biological reactions rarely obtain equilibrium because the concentrations of the reactants or products or both are
constantly changing, often with one reaction's product a reactant for another. To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions
in the blood, forming carbonic acid will be the reaction's major direction. However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as
carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of converting back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the
law of mass action. These reactions are important for maintaining homeostasis in our blood.
Ions and Ionic Bonds
Some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost
electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of
protons, each ion has a net charge.Cationsare positive ions that form by losing electrons. Negative ions form by gaining
electrons, which we call anions. We designateanionsby their elemental name and change the ending to “-ide”, thus the anion of
chlorine is chloride, and the anion of sulfur is sulfide.
Scientists refer to this movement of electrons from one element to another aselectron transfer. AsFigure 2.11illustrates,
sodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it
does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and
only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. We now refer to it as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy
state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one
electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons,
giving it a net negative (–1) charge. We now refer to it as a chloride ion. In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to
empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete
outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1
(sodium cation) or –1 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order
for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.
Figure2.11In the formation of an ionic compound, metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve an octet.
Ionic bondsform between ions with opposite charges. For instance, positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged
chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride, or table salt, creating a crystalline molecule with zero net

nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two
electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent
molecule.
Figure2.12Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and carbon dioxide have
polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.
Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions
Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break. Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines
their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between
molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types
of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water
and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.
When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because
hydrogen’s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is
slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the
hydrogen'sδ+from one molecule and the molecule'sδ–charge on another molecule with the more electronegative atoms,
usually oxygen. Scientists call this interaction ahydrogen bond. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between
water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and
in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA
double helix.
Like hydrogen bonds,van der Waals interactionsare weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals
attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities,
which are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one
another. These bonds—along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds—contribute to the proteins' three-dimensional structure
in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.

Water
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the properties of water that are critical to maintaining life
• Explain why water is an excellent solvent
• Provide examples of water’s cohesive and adhesive properties
• Discuss the role of acids, bases, and buffers in homeostasis
Why do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? Why is water so important? It is because water is essential to
life as we know it. Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth. Water comprises
approximately 60–70 percent of the human body. Without it, life as we know it simply would not exist.
The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties
that are intimately tied to the processes of life. Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an organism’s
cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell’s cytoplasm. Special properties of water are its
high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its
dissociation into ions that leads to generating pH. Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its
importance in maintaining life.
Water’s Polarity
One of water’s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules
(H O) form polar covalent bonds. While there is no net charge to a water molecule, water's polarity creates a slightly positive
2
charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water’s properties of attraction. Water generates
charges because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that a shared electron would be near the
oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative charge near theoxygen.
As a result of water’s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between
water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. We call a polar
substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in waterhydrophilic(hydro- = “water”; -philic = “loving”). In contrast, nonpolar
molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, asFigure 2.13shows. A good example of this is vinegar and oil
salad dressing (an acidic water solution). We call such nonpolar compoundshydrophobic(hydro- = “water”; -phobic = “fearing”).

Figure2.13Oil and water do not mix. As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but forms droplets instead.
This is because it is a nonpolar compound. (credit: Gautam Dogra).
Water’s States: Gas, Liquid, and Solid
The formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. As water
molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other
liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. In
liquid water, hydrogen bonds constantly form and break as the water molecules slide past each other. The water molecules'
motion (kinetic energy) causes the bonds to break due to the heat contained in the system. When the heat rises as water boils,
the water molecules' higher kinetic energy causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape
into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). Alternatively, when water temperature reduces and water freezes, the water molecules
form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that
makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon that we do not see when other liquids solidify.
Water’s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds orient as they freeze: the water molecules push farther
apart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes lowering kinetic
energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density
than the liquid.
The lower density of ice, asFigure 2.14depicts, an anomaly causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg
or ice cubes in a glass of water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the water's surface creating an insulating barrier that
protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this insulating ice layer, plants and animals living in the
pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The expansion of ice relative to liquid water causes the
detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms. The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes
essential for living cells to function, irreversibly damaging them. Cells can only survive freezing if another liquid like glycerol
temporarily replaces the water in them.

When we add ionic compounds to water, the individual ions react with the water molecules' polar regions and their ionic bonds
are disrupted in the process ofdissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and
form ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when we add NaCl crystals to water, the NaCl molecules dissociate
into Na+and Cl–ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, asFigure 2.15illustrates. The partially negative charge of
the water molecule’s oxygen surrounds the positively charged sodium ion. The hydrogen's partially positive charge on the water
molecule surrounds the negatively charged chloride ion.
Figure2.15When we mix table salt (NaCl) in water, it forms spheres of hydration around the ions.
Water’s Cohesive and Adhesive Properties
Have you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the water forms
a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property ofcohesion. In
cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the
liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.
Cohesion allows forsurface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupturing when placed under tension or stress.
This is also why water forms droplets when on a dry surface rather than flattening by gravity. When we place a small scrap of
paper onto a water droplet, the paper floats on top even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface
tension keep the water molecules' hydrogen bonds intact and support the item floating on the top. It’s even possible to “float” a
needle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently without breaking the surface tension, asFigure 2.16shows.
Figure2.16A needle's weight pulls the surface downward. At the same time, the surface tension pulls it up, suspending it on the water's
surface preventing it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around the needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)
These cohesive forces are related to water’s property ofadhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other
molecules. This attraction is sometimes stronger than water’s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged
surfaces such as those on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. We observe adhesion when water “climbs” up
the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the tube's sides than in the middle. This is
because the water molecules are attracted to the capillary's charged glass walls more than they are to each other and therefore
adhere to it. We call this type of adhesioncapillary action, asFigure 2.17illustrates.

way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc.). One mole represents the atomic weight of
a substance, expressed in grams, which equals the amount of the substance containing as many units as there are atoms in 12
grams of12C. Mathematically, one mole is equal to 6.02 × 1023particles of the substance. Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to

## Section 71.2
× 1023water molecules. We calculate the pH as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. The log10 of 1 ×
10-7is -7.0, and the negative of this number (indicated by the “p” of “pH”) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also a neutral pH. The pH
inside of human cells and blood are examples of two body areas where near-neutral pH is maintained.
Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive
integers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number; whereas, low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH.
Anacidis a substance that increases hydrogen ions' (H+) concentration in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen
atoms dissociate. Abaseprovides either hydroxide ions (OH–) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen
ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions,
these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.
The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into hydrogen
and chloride ions and is highly acidic; whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and are weak
acids. Conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH–or take up hydrogen ions. Sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH–rapidly when we place them in water, thereby raising
the pH. An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0 This is close enough to a neutral pH that
marine organisms have adapted in order to live and thrive in a saline environment.
ThepH scaleis, as we previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (Figure 2.19). Anything below 7.0
(ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. Extremes in pH in either direction from

are usually inhospitable to life. The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral. However,
the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2. As a result, how do stomach cells survive in such an acidic
environment? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them? The answer is that they cannot do it and
are constantly dying. The stomach constantly produces new cells to replace dead ones, which stomach acids digest. Scientists
estimate that the human body completely replaces the stomach lining every seven to ten days.

Carbon
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain why carbon is important for life
• Describe the role of functional groups in biological molecules
Many complex molecules called macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and lipids
comprise cells. The macromolecules are a subset oforganic molecules(any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are
especially important for life. The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. The carbon atom has
unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to
serve as the basic structural component, or “backbone,” of the macromolecules.
Individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six
protons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. Therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four
covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. The methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical
formula CH . Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons.
4
This results in a filled outermost shell.
Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbonsare organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH ) described above. We
4
often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels—like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many covalent
bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which releases when these molecules burn (oxidize).
Methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen
atoms, asFigure 2.21illustrates. The shape of its electron orbitals determines the shape of the methane molecule's geometry,
where the atoms reside in three dimensions. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a tetrahedron, with four triangular
faces. For this reason, we describe methane as having tetrahedral geometry.
Figure2.21Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5° apart.
As the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or
combinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and
each type of bond affects the molecule's geometry in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large
molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.
Hydrocarbon Chains
Successive bonds between carbon atoms form hydrocarbon chains. These may be branched or unbranched. Furthermore, a
molecule's different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds alter the overall molecule's geometry asFigure 2.22
illustrates. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the
molecule's geometry. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix “eth-,” which is the prefix for two carbon
hydrocarbons. The suffixes “-ane,” “-ene,” and “-yne” refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds,
respectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butene, and
butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the molecule's geometry: single bonds allow
rotation along the bond's axis; whereas, double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one. These

In triglycerides (fats and oils), long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds, which can be in either thecis
ortransconfiguration, asFigure 2.25illustrates. Fats with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are unsaturated fats.
When some of these bonds are in thecisconfiguration, the resulting bend in the chain's carbon backbone means that
triglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly, so they remain liquid (oil) at room temperature. Alternatively, triglycerides withtrans
double bonds (popularly called trans fats), have relatively linear fatty acids that are able to pack tightly together at room
temperature and form solid fats. In the human diet, trans fats are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so many
food manufacturers have reduced or eliminated their use in recent years. In contrast to unsaturated fats, we call triglycerides

biological molecules. They include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl. These groups play an
important role in forming molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. We usually classify functional groups as
hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An example of a hydrophobic group is the
nonpolar methyl molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group in amino acids, some amino acid side
chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids. This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H+)
from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO-group. This contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever
molecule on which it is found. Other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen
atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic.
Figure2.27These functional groups are in many different biological molecules. R, also known as R-group, is an abbreviation for any group
in which a carbon or hydrogen atom is attached to the rest of the molecule.
Hydrogen bonds between functional groups (within the same molecule or between different molecules) are important to the
function of many macromolecules and help them to fold properly into and maintain the appropriate shape for functioning.
Hydrogen bonds are also involved in various recognition processes, such as DNA complementary base pairing and the binding
of an enzyme to its substrate, asFigure 2.28illustrates.

Carbohydrates
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the role of carbohydrates in cells and in the extracellular materials of animals and plants
• Explain carbohydrate classifications
• List common monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides
Most people are familiar with carbohydrates, one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat. To lose
weight, some individuals adhere to “low-carb” diets. Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to
ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet. Grains,
fruits, and vegetables are all natural carbohydrate sources that provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple
sugar that is a component ofstarchand an ingredient in many staple foods. Carbohydrates also have other important functions
in humans, animals, and plants.
Molecular Structures
The stoichiometric formula (CH O) , wherenis the number of carbons in the molecule representscarbohydrates. In other
2 n
words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula also explains the origin of the
term “carbohydrate”: the components are carbon (“carbo”) and the components of water (hence, “hydrate”). Scientists classify
carbohydrates into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides(mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In
monosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix
-ose. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is an aldose, and if it has a ketone
group (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R'), it is a ketose. Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they
can be trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and/or hexoses (six carbons).Figure 3.4illustrates monosaccharides.

Figure3.5Glucose, galactose, and fructose are all hexoses. They are structural isomers, meaning they have the same chemical formula

What kind of sugars are these, aldose or ketose?
Glucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides (hexoses), meaning they have the same chemical formula but
have slightly different structures. Glucose and galactose are aldoses, and fructose is a ketose.
Monosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules. In aqueous solutions they are usually in ring forms
(Figure 3.6). Glucose in a ring form can have two different hydroxyl group arrangements (OH) around the anomeric carbon
(carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the ring formation process). If the hydroxyl group is below carbon number 1 in the sugar,
it is in the alpha (α) position, and if it is above the plane, it is in the beta (β) position.

Figure3.7Sucrose forms when a glucose monomer and a fructose monomer join in a dehydration reaction to form a glycosidic bond. In the
process, a water molecule is lost. By convention, the carbon atoms in a monosaccharide are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to
the carbonyl group. In sucrose, a glycosidic linkage forms between carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose.
Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose (Figure 3.8). Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers
glucose and galactose. It is naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed by a dehydration reaction between
two glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is comprised of glucose and fructose
monomers.

way the subunits are joined, the glucose chains have a helical structure. Glycogen (not shown) is similar in structure to amylopectin but
more highly branched.
Glycogenis the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is comprised of monomers of glucose. Glycogen is
the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever blood
glucose levels decrease, glycogen breaks down to release glucose in a process scientists call glycogenolysis.

Registered Dietitian
Obesity is a worldwide health concern, and many diseases such as diabetes and heart disease are becoming more prevalent
because of obesity. This is one of the reasons why people increasingly seek out registered dietitians for advice. Registered
dietitians help plan nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. They often work with patients in health care facilities,
designing nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases. For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to
manage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing
homes, schools, and private practices.
To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor’s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a
related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass a national exam. Those
who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human
physiology. Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins,
carbohydrates, and fats).
Benefits of Carbohydrates
Are carbohydrates good for you? Some people believe that carbohydrates are bad and they should avoid them. Some diets
completely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate diet helps people to lose weight faster. However,
carbohydrates have been an important part of the human diet for thousands of years. Artifacts from ancient civilizations show
the presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors’ storage areas.
As part of a well balanced diet, we should supplement carbohydrates with proteins, vitamins, and fats. Calorie-wise, a gram of
carbohydrate provides 4.3 Kcal. For comparison, fats provide 9 Kcal/g, a less desirable ratio. Carbohydrates contain soluble and
insoluble elements. The insoluble part, fiber, is mostly cellulose. Fiber has many uses. It promotes regular bowel movement by
adding bulk, and it regulates the blood glucose consumption rate. Fiber also helps to remove excess cholesterol from the body.
Fiber binds to the cholesterol in the small intestine, then attaches to the cholesterol and prevents the cholesterol particles from
entering the bloodstream. Cholesterol then exits the body via the feces. Fiber-rich diets also have a protective role in reducing
the occurrence of colon cancer. In addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives a feeling of fullness. As an
immediate source of energy, glucose breaks down during the cellular respiration process, which produces ATP, the cell's energy
currency. Without consuming carbohydrates, we reduce the availability of “instant energy”. Eliminating carbohydrates from the
diet may be necessary for some people, but such a step may not be healthy for everyone.

• Explain the role of fats in storing energy
• Differentiate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
• Describe phospholipids and their role in cells
• Define the basic structure of a steroid and some steroid functions

Lipidsinclude a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature. This is because they are hydrocarbons that
include mostly nonpolar carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (“water fearing”), or
insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats.
Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 3.12). For example, they help keep aquatic
birds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water-repellant hydrophobic

Figure3.13Joining three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone in a dehydration reaction forms triacylglycerol. Three water molecules release
in the process.
During this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar
or dissimilar. We also call fatstriacylglycerolsortriglyceridesbecause of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have
common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, asaturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree.
Arachidic acid is derived fromArachis hypogea,the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.
Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in
the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen. In other words, the
number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid
(Figure 3.14).

Figure3.16Saturated fatty acids have hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds only. Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more
double bonds. Each double bond may be in acisortransconfiguration. In thecisconfiguration, both hydrogens are on the same side of the
hydrocarbon chain. In thetransconfiguration, the hydrogens are on opposite sides. Acisdouble bond causes a kink in the chain.
Trans Fats
The food industry artificially hydrogenates oils to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many processed food
products. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation process, double
bonds of thecis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may convert to double bonds in thetrans- conformation.
Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies have
shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to higher levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or “bad”
cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants
have recently banned using trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.
Omega Fatty Acids
Essential fatty acids are those that the human body requires but does not synthesize. Consequently, they have to be
supplemented through ingestion via the diet.Omega-3 fatty acids (like those inFigure 3.17) fall into this category and are one of
only two known for humans (the other is omega-6 fatty acid). These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are omega-3 because a
double bond connects the third carbon from the hydrocarbon chain's end to its neighboring carbon.

triglycerides, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and a modified phosphate group occupies the glycerol backbone's
third carbon (Figure 3.19). A phosphate group alone attached to a diacylglycerol does not qualify as a phospholipid. It is
phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids. An alcohol modifies the phosphate group.
Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are in plasma membranes.
Figure3.19A phospholipid is a molecule with two fatty acids and a modified phosphate group attached to a glycerol backbone. Adding a
charged or polar chemical group may modify the phosphate.
A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. The fatty acid chains are
hydrophobic and cannot interact with water; whereas, the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water
(Figure 3.20).
Figure3.20The phospholipid bilayer is the major component of all cellular membranes. The hydrophilic head groups of the phospholipids
face the aqueous solution. The hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the middle of the bilayer.
The head is the hydrophilic part, and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids. In a membrane, a bilayer of phospholipids
forms the structure's matrix, phospholipids' fatty acid tails face inside, away from water; whereas, the phosphate group faces
the outside, aqueous side (Figure 3.20).
Phospholipids are responsible for the plasma membrane's dynamic nature. If a drop of phospholipids is placed in water, it
spontaneously forms a structure that scientists call a micelle, where the hydrophilic phosphate heads face the outside and the
fatty acids face the structure's interior.

Types and Functions of Proteins
Enzymes, which living cells produce, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or
conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) upon which it acts. The
enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. We call enzymes that break down their substrates
catabolic enzymes. Those that build more complex molecules from their substrates are anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that
affect the rate of reaction are catalytic enzymes. Note that all enzymes increase the reaction rate and, therefore, are organic
catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.
Hormonesare chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or
regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin
is a protein hormone that helps regulate the blood glucose level.Table 3.1lists the primary types and functions of proteins.

Table3.1
Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights. Some proteins are globular in shape; whereas, others are fibrous in
nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, located in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is
critical to its function, and many different types of chemical bonds maintain this shape. Changes in temperature, pH, and
exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the protein's shape, leading to loss of function, ordenaturation.
Different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids comprise all proteins. Two rare new amino acids were discovered
recently (selenocystein and pirrolysine), and additional new discoveries may be added to the list.
Amino Acids
Amino acidsare the monomers that comprise proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of
a central carbon atom, or the alpha (α) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH ), a carboxyl group (COOH), and to a hydrogen
2
atom. Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as the R group (Figure 3.22).

VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure3.23There are 20 common amino acids commonly found in proteins, each with a different R group (variant group) that determines
its chemical nature.
Which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on a soluble protein's surface and which would you expect to find in the
interior? What distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in a protein embedded in a lipid bilayer?
The chemical nature of the side chain determines the amino acid's nature (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).
For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine
are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic
side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also basic amino
acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the
amino acid's standard structure since its amino group is not separate from the side chain (Figure 3.23).
A single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation represents amino acids. For example, the letter V or the three-letter
symbol val represent valine. Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids also are necessary. These essential
amino acids in humans include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential amino acids refer to those necessary to build proteins
in the body, but not those that the body produces. Which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.
The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein's shape, size, and function. A covalent bond, or
peptide bond, attaches to each amino acid, which a dehydration reaction forms. One amino acid's carboxyl group and the
incoming amino acid's amino group combine, releasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond (Figure 3.24).

Primary Structure
Amino acids' unique sequence in a polypeptide chain is itsprimary structure. For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has
two polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is
glycine; whereas, the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.25). The amino acid sequences in the A and B chains are
unique to insulin.
Figure3.25Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone comprised of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30 amino acids
long). In each chain, three-letter abbreviations that represent the amino acids' names in the order they are present indicate primary
structure. The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of
oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond. Two disulfide bonds connect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the
correct shape. Note that all disulfide bonds are the same length, but we have drawn them different sizes for clarity.
The gene encoding the protein ultimately determines the unique sequence for every protein. A change in nucleotide sequence of
the gene’s coding region may lead to adding a different amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in
protein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobinβchain (a small portion of which we show inFigure 3.26)
has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function. Specifically, valine in theβchain
substitutes the amino acid glutamic. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is comprised of two
alpha and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The
structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—which dramatically decreases life
expectancy—is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more remarkable is that three nucleotides each encode those 600
amino acids, and a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases causes the mutation.
Figure3.26The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to sickle cell anemia. In
normal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate. In sickle cell hemoglobin, a valine replaces glutamate.
Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or
disc-shaped, red blood cells and causes them to assume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs blood vessels (Figure 3.27). This

Tertiary Structure
The polypeptide's unique three-dimensional structure is itstertiary structure(Figure 3.29). This structure is in part due to
chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the interactions among R groups create the protein's complex
three-dimensional tertiary structure. The nature of the R groups in the amino acids involved can counteract forming the
hydrogen bonds we described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups with like charges repel each other and
those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When protein folding takes place, the nonpolar amino acids'
hydrophobic R groups lie in the protein's interior; whereas, the hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside. Scientists also call the
former interaction types hydrophobic interactions. Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the
presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond that forms during protein folding.
Figure3.29A variety of chemical interactions determine the proteins' tertiary structure. These include hydrophobic interactions, ionic
bonding, hydrogen bonding, and disulfide linkages.
All of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the protein's final three-dimensional shape. When a protein loses its
three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.
Quaternary Structure
In nature, some proteins form from several polypeptides, or subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the
quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For example, insulin (a
globular protein) has a combination of hydrogen and disulfide bonds that cause it to mostly clump into a ball shape. Insulin
starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of post-translational modification after
forming the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together. Silk (a fibrous protein), however, has aβ-pleated sheet
structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.
Figure 3.30illustrates the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary).

## Section 93.2
Nucleic Acids
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe nucleic acids' structure and define the two types of nucleic acids
• Explain DNA's structure and role
• Explain RNA's structure and roles
Nucleic acidsare the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life. They carry the cell's genetic blueprint and carry
instructions for its functioning.
DNA and RNA
The two main types of nucleic acids aredeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)andribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the genetic material in
all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the
organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.
The cell's entire genetic content is its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes,
DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may
contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products. Other genes code for RNA
products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes “on” or “off.”
The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but
instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is themessenger RNA (mRNA). Other
types of RNA—like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA—are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.
DNA and RNA are comprised of monomers that scientists callnucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a
polynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Three components comprise each nucleotide: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar,
and a phosphate group (Figure 3.31). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to
one or more phosphate groups.

--- Page 106 ---
86

# Chapter 94

## Section 94.1
• Nucleic Acids 87
The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (Figure 3.31). The difference between the sugars is the
presence of the hydroxyl group on the ribose's second carbon and hydrogen on the deoxyribose's second carbon. The carbon
atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”). The phosphate residue attaches to the
hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which
forms a 5′–3′phosphodiesterlinkage. A simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in
macromolecules does not form the phosphodiester linkage. Its formation involves removing two phosphate groups. A
polynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.
DNA Double-Helix Structure
DNA has a double-helix structure (Figure 3.32). The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the DNA's
backbone. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like a pair of staircase steps. Hydrogen bonds bind the pairs to each
other. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. The helix's two strands run in opposite
directions, meaning that the 5′ carbon end of one strand will face the 3′ carbon end of its matching strand. (Scientists call this an
antiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.)
Figure3.32Native DNA is an antiparallel double helix. The phosphate backbone (indicated by the curvy lines) is on the outside, and the
bases are on the inside. Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base from the opposing strand. (credit: Jerome
Walker/Dennis Myts)
Only certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This means
A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, asFigure 3.33shows. This is the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA
strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have
the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand copies itself, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix
containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.

site. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to insert itself in the polypeptide
chain. MicroRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves regulating gene expression by interfering with the
expression of certain mRNA messages.Table 3.2summarizes DNA and RNA features.

Pyrimidines Cytosine, thymine Cytosine, uracil
Purines Adenine, guanine Adenine, guanine
Table3.2
Even though the RNA is single stranded, most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary
sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function.
As you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein. DNA dictates the structure of
mRNA in a process scientists calltranscription, and RNA dictates the protein's structure in a process scientists calltranslation.
This is the Central Dogma of Life, which holds true for all organisms; however, exceptions to the rule occur in connection with
viral infections.

does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 4.3), it also provides higher resolving power. The method
to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. Electrons have short wavelengths (shorter
than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so we cannot view living cells with an electron microscope.
In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, creating details of cell
surface characteristics. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell and provides details of a
cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light

Cell Theory
The microscopes we use today are far more complex than those that Dutch shopkeeper Antony van Leeuwenhoek, used in the
1600s. Skilled in crafting lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of single-celled organisms, which he collectively
termed “animalcules.”
In the 1665 publicationMicrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” for the box-like structures he
observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later
advances in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other scientists to see some components inside
cells.

Prokaryotic Cells
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Name examples of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms
• Compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
• Describe the relative sizes of different cells
• Explain why cells must be small
Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. We classify only the predominantly single-celled
organisms Bacteria and Archaea as prokaryotes (pro- = “before”; -kary- = “nucleus”). Animal cells, plants, fungi, and protists are
all eukaryotes (eu- = “true”).
Components of Prokaryotic Cells
All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior from its
surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which there are other cellular
components; 3) DNA, the cell's genetic material; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from
eukaryotic cells in several ways.

organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is in the cell's central
part: thenucleoid(Figure 4.5).
Figure4.5This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell. All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid,
ribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall. The other structures shown are present in some, but not all, bacteria.
Most prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5). The cell wall acts as an
extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to
surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion. Pili exchange
genetic material during conjugation, the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another through direct
contact. Bacteria use fimbriae to attach to a host cell.
CAREER CONNECTION
Microbiologist
The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or her hands. Why?
Because microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are ubiquitous. They live on doorknobs,
money, your hands, and many other surfaces. If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you
touch that same doorknob, the microbes from the sneezer’s mucus are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your
mouth, nose, or eyes, those microbes can enter your body and could make you sick.
However, not all microbes (also called microorganisms) cause disease; most are actually beneficial. You have microbes in your
gut that make vitamin K. Other microorganisms are used to ferment beer and wine.
Microbiologists are scientists who study microbes. Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers. Not only do they work in the
food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can work in the pharmaceutical sector, serving
key roles in research and development by identifying new antibiotic sources that can treat bacterial infections.
Environmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered microbes to remove
pollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from contaminated sites. We call using these microbes
bioremediation technologies. Microbiologists can also work in the bioinformatics field, providing specialized knowledge and
insight for designing, developing, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics.
Cell Size
At 0.1 to 5.0 μm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from
10 to 100 μm (Figure 4.6). The prokaryotes' small size allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to
other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse. This is not the case in
eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.

Eukaryotic Cells
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the structure of eukaryotic cells
• Compare animal cells with plant cells
• State the role of the plasma membrane
• Summarize the functions of the major cell organelles
Have you ever heard the phrase “form follows function?” It’s a philosophy that many industries follow. In architecture, this
means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example, a
skyscraper should include several elevator banks. A hospital should have its emergency room easily accessible.
Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear as
we explore eukaryotic cells (Figure 4.8). Unlike prokaryotic cells,eukaryotic cellshave: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus; 2)
numerous membrane-boundorganellessuch as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and
others; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. Because a membrane surrounds eukaryotic cell’s nucleus, it has a “true
nucleus.” The word “organelle” means “little organ,” and, as we already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions,
just as your body's organs have specialized functions.
At this point, it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells. Organelles
allow different functions to be compartmentalized in different areas of the cell. Before turning to organelles, let’s first examine
two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.

microvillus); (Figure 4.10). Such cells typically line the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This
is an excellent example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a
protein in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb
nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free
diet.
Figure4.10Microvilli, as they appear on cells lining the small intestine, increase the surface area available for absorption. These microvilli
are only on the area of the plasma membrane that faces the cavity from which substances will be absorbed. (credit "micrograph":
modification of work by Louisa Howard)
The Cytoplasm
Thecytoplasmis the cell's entire region between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure we will discuss
shortly). It is comprised of organelles suspended in the gel-likecytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals (Figure 4.8).
Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins
within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars,
polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are also there. Ions of sodium, potassium,
calcium, and many other elements also dissolve in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take
place in the cytoplasm.
The Nucleus
Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell (Figure 4.8). Thenucleus(plural = nuclei) houses the cell’s DNA
and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let’s look at it in more detail (Figure 4.11).
Figure4.11The nucleus stores chromatin (DNA plus proteins) in a gel-like substance called the nucleoplasm. The nucleolus is a condensed
chromatin region where ribosome synthesis occurs. We call the nucleus' boundary the nuclear envelope. It consists of two phospholipid
bilayers: an outer and an inner membrane. The nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear pores allow
substances to enter and exit the nucleus.

Figure4.13A large subunit (top) and a small subunit (bottom) comprise ribosomes. During protein synthesis, ribosomes assemble amino
acids into proteins.
Because protein synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural
components, and surface receptors), there are ribosomes in practically every cell. Ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells
that synthesize large amounts of protein. For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive enzymes and
the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. Thus, we see another example of form following function.
Mitochondria
Scientists often callmitochondria(singular = mitochondrion) “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of both plant and animal cells
because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP
represents the cell's short-term stored energy. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in
glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In fact,
the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a
byproduct.
In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high
concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving. When
your cells don’t get enough oxygen, they do not make much ATP. Instead, producing lactic acid accompanies the small amount of
ATP they make in the absence of oxygen.
Mitochondria are oval-shaped, double membrane organelles (Figure 4.14) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each
membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae. We call the area
surrounded by the folds the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.
Figure4.14This electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion through an electron microscope. This organelle has an outer membrane and
an inner membrane. The inner membrane contains folds, called cristae, which increase its surface area. We call the space between the two
membranes the intermembrane space, and the space inside the inner membrane the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthesis takes place on

If you examineFigure 4.8, the plant cell diagram, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane. This is thecell wall,
a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal and some protistan cells
also have cell walls. While the prokaryotic cell walls' chief component is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant
(and some protists') cell wall is cellulose (Figure 4.16), a polysaccharide comprised of glucose units. Have you ever noticed that
when you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches? That’s because you are tearing the celery cells' rigid cell walls with
your teeth.
Figure4.16Cellulose is a long chain of β-glucose molecules connected by a 1-4 linkage. The dashed lines at each end of the figure indicate
a series of many more glucose units. The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an entire cellulose molecule.
Chloroplasts
Like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function.
Chloroplastsare plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon
dioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. This is a major difference between plants and animals. Plants
(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars used in cellular respiration to provide ATP energy generated in the
plant mitochondria. Animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s inner
membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs we call thylakoids (Figure 4.17). Each thylakoid
stack is a granum (plural = grana). We call the fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana the stroma.
Figure4.17The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures - thylakoids that are stacked into
grana. We call the space inside the thylakoid membranes the thylakoid space. The light harvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid
membranes, and sugar synthesis takes place in the fluid inside the inner membrane, which we call the stroma. Chloroplasts also have their
own genome, which is contained on a single circular chromosome.
The chloroplasts contain a green pigment,chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of
photosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but their
chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.

The Endomembrane System and Proteins
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the components of the endomembrane system
• Recognize the relationship between the endomembrane system and its functions
The endomembrane system (endo = “within”) is a group of membranes and organelles (Figure 4.18) in eukaryotic cells that works
together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and vesicles, which
we have already mentioned, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. Although not
technicallywithinthe cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see, it interacts
with the other endomembranous organelles. The endomembrane system does not include either mitochondria or chloroplast
membranes.

VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure4.18Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The RER also sometimes
modifies proteins. In this illustration, an attachment of a (purple) carbohydrate modifies a (green) integral membrane protein in the ER.
Vesicles with the integral protein bud from the ER and fuse with the Golgi apparatus' cis face. As the protein passes along the Golgi’s
cisternae, the addition of more carbohydrates further modifies it. After its synthesis is complete, it exits as an integral membrane protein of
the vesicle that buds from the Golgi’stransface. When the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, the protein becomes an integral portion of
that cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Magnus Manske)
If a peripheral membrane protein were synthesized in the lumen (inside) of the ER, would it end up on the inside or outside of
the plasma membrane?
The Endoplasmic Reticulum
Theendoplasmic reticulum (ER)(Figure 4.18) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively
modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids. However, these two functions take place in separate areas of the ER: the rough ER and
the smooth ER, respectively.
We call the ER tubules' hollow portion the lumen or cisternal space. The ER's membrane, which is a phospholipid bilayer
embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.
Rough ER
Scientists have named therough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)as such because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic

salt intake and a supervised exercise program.
The Golgi Apparatus
We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the vesicles
go? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need sorting, packaging, and
tagging so that they end up in the right place. Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distributing lipids and proteins takes place in
theGolgi apparatus(also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranes (Figure 4.20).
Figure4.20The Golgi apparatus in this white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular, flattened rings in the lower portion of the image.
You can see several vesicles near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard)
We call the Golgi apparatus' thecisface. The opposite side is thetransface. The transport vesicles that formed from the ER travel
to thecisface, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the Golgi apparatus' lumen. As the proteins and lipids travel through
the Golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow them to be sorted. The most frequent modification is adding short
sugar molecule chains. These newly modified proteins and lipids then tag with phosphate groups or other small molecules in
order to travel to their proper destinations.
Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the Golgi'stransface. While some
of these vesicles deposit their contents into other cell parts where they will be used, other secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma
membrane and release their contents outside the cell.
In another example of form following function, cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as salivary gland cells
that secrete digestive enzymes or immune system cells that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of Golgi.
In plant cells, the Golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into
the cell wall and some of which other cell parts use.
CAREER CONNECTION
Geneticist
Many diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent synthesizing critical proteins. One such disease is Lowe disease (or
oculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys). In Lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme
localized to the Golgi apparatus. Children with Lowe disease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the
first year of life, and may have impaired mental abilities.
A mutation on the X chromosome causes Lowe disease. The X chromosome is one of the two human sex chromosomes, as these
chromosomes determine a person's sex. Females possess two X chromosomes while males possess one X and one Y
chromosome. In females, the genes on only one of the two X chromosomes are expressed. Females who carry the Lowe disease
gene on one of their X chromosomes are carriers and do not show symptoms of the disease. However, males only have one X
chromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have Lowe disease if their X
chromosome carries the Lowe disease gene. Geneticists have identified the mutated gene's location, as well as many other
mutation locations that cause genetic diseases. Through prenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may
be afflicted with one of several genetic diseases.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the cytoskeleton
• Compare the roles of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules
• Compare and contrast cilia and flagella
• Summarize the differences among the components of prokaryotic cells, animal cells, and plant cells
If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components left?
No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain
the cell's shape, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enable
cells within multicellular organisms to move. Collectively, scientists call this network of protein fibers thecytoskeleton. There
are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 4.22). Here,
we will examine each.

## Section 110.2
• The Cytoskeleton 113
Figure4.22Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the cell's inner edge. Like rubber bands, they resist tension. There are microtubules in
the cell's interior where they maintain their shape by resisting compressive forces. There are intermediate filaments throughout the cell
that hold organelles in place.
Microfilaments
Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton,microfilamentsare the narrowest. They function in cellular movement,
have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are comprised of two globular protein intertwined strands, which we call actin (Figure 4.23).
For this reason, we also call microfilaments actin filaments.

# Chapter 111

## Section 111.1
• The Cytoskeleton 115
The intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements. Several fibrous protein types are in the
intermediate filaments. You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and
the skin's epidermis.
Microtubules
As their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. Polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, two globular
proteins, comprise the microtubule's walls (Figure 4.25). With a diameter of about 25 nm,microtubulesare cytoskeletons'
widest components. They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull
replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. Like microfilaments, microtubules can disassemble and reform
quickly.
Figure4.25Microtubules are hollow. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (right image). The left image
shows the tube's molecular structure.
Microtubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the centrosome's two perpendicular
bodies). In animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite
different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as we discuss below.
Flagella and Cilia
Theflagella(singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and enable an entire cell
to move (for example, sperm,Euglena, and some prokaryotes). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella.
However, whencilia(singular = cilium) are present, many of them extend along the plasma membrane's entire surface. They are
short, hair-like structures that move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the cell's outer surface (for example, the
cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that
trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)
Despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called
a “9 + 2 array.” This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets,
surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26).

Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the extracellular matrix
• List examples of the ways that plant cells and animal cells communicate with adjacent cells
• Summarize the roles of tight junctions, desmosomes, gap junctions, and plasmodesmata
You already know that tissue is a group of similar cells working together. As you might expect, if cells are to work together, they
must communicate with each other, just as you need to communicate with others if you work on a group project. Let’s take a
look at how cells communicate with each other.
Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells
While cells in most multicellular organisms release materials into the extracellular space, animal cells will be discussed as an
example. The primary components of these materials are proteins, and the most abundant protein is collagen. Collagen fibers
are interwoven with proteoglycans, which are carbohydrate-containing protein molecules. Collectively, we call these materials
theextracellular matrix(Figure 4.27). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also

Tight Junctions
Atight junctionis a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 4.29). Proteins (predominantly two proteins called
claudins and occludins) tightly hold the cells against each other.
Figure4.29Tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells. Proteins create tight junction adherence. (credit:

This tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells; tight junctions are typically found in epithelial tissues
that line internal organs and cavities, and comprise most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells
lining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular space.
Desmosomes
Also only in animal cells aredesmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 4.30). Cadherins,

Gap junctions develop when a set of six proteins (connexins) in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in an elongated
donut-like configuration - a connexon. When the connexon's pores (“doughnut holes”) in adjacent animal cells align, a channel
between the two cells forms. Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle. The electrical signal for the muscle to
contract passes efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem.

## Section 121.1
Components and Structure
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Understand the cell membrane fluid mosaic model
• Describe phospholipid, protein, and carbohydrate functions in membranes
• Discuss membrane fluidity
A cell’s plasma membrane defines the cell, outlines its borders, and determines the nature of its interaction
with its environment (seeTable 5.1for a summary). Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and
excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain
cells, such as red and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are
the more obvious plasma membrane functions. In addition, the plasma membrane's surface carries markers
that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital for tissue and organ formation during early
development, and which later plays a role in the immune response's “self” versus “non-self” distinction.
Among the most sophisticated plasma membrane functions is the ability for complex, integral proteins,
receptors to transmit signals. These proteins act both as extracellular input receivers and as intracellular
processing activators. These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like
hormones and growth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are
bound. Occasionally, viruses hijack receptors (HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, is one example) that
use them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated, causing the
signal transduction process to malfunction with disastrous consequences.
Fluid Mosaic Model
Scientists identified the plasma membrane in the 1890s, and its chemical components in 1915. The principal
components they identified were lipids and proteins. In 1935, Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed the
plasma membrane's structure. This was the first model that others in the scientific community widely
accepted. It was based on the plasma membrane's “railroad track” appearance in early electron micrographs.
Davson and Danielli theorized that the plasma membrane's structure resembles a sandwich. They made the
analogy of proteins to bread, and lipids to the filling. In the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the plasma membrane's core
consisted of a double, rather than a single, layer. In 1972, S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new
model that provides microscopic observations and better explains plasma membrane function.
The explanation, thefluid mosaic model, has evolved somewhat over time, but it still best accounts for
plasma membrane structure and function as we now understand them. The fluid mosaic model describes
the plasma membrane structure as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol,
proteins, and carbohydrates—that gives the membrane a fluid character. Plasma membranes range from 5
to 10 nm in thickness. For comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are
approximately 8 µm wide, or approximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane. The membrane
does look a bit like a sandwich (Figure 5.2).

## Section 121.2
• Components and Structure 129
Figure5.2The plasma membrane fluid mosaic model describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of phospholipids,
cholesterol, and proteins. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the membrane's
outward-facing surface.
A plasma membrane's principal components are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates attached to
some of the lipids and proteins. A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked
head group. Cholesterol, another lipid comprised of four fused carbon rings, is situated alongside the phospholipids in the
membrane's core. The protein, lipid, and carbohydrate proportions in the plasma membrane vary with cell type, but for a typical
human cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids (of all types) account for about 40 percent,
and carbohydrates comprise the remaining 10 percent. However, protein and lipid concentration varies with different cell
membranes. For example, myelin, an outgrowth of specialized cells' membrane that insulates the peripheral nerves' axons,
contains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and only
24 percent lipid. The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. Carbohydrates are present only on the
plasma membrane's exterior surface and are attached to proteins, formingglycoproteins, or attached to lipids, forming
glycolipids.
Phospholipids
The membrane's main fabric comprises amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules. Thehydrophilicor “water-loving” areas of these
molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure 5.2) are in contact with the aqueous
fluid both inside and outside the cell.Hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar. They interact with other
non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules. When placed in water,
hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The phospholipids' hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with water
and other polar molecules on both the cell's exterior and interior. Thus, the membrane surfaces that face the cell's interior and
exterior are hydrophilic. In contrast, the cell membrane's interior is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Therefore,
phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside the cell.
A phospholipid molecule (Figure 5.3) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached to
carbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon. This arrangement gives the overall molecule a
head area (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge, and a tail area (the fatty acids),
which has no charge. The head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot. Scientists call a molecule with a positively or
negatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, areaamphiphilicor “dual-loving.”

tails facing inward. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
Proteins
Proteins comprise the plasma membranes' second major component.Integral proteins, or integrins, as their name suggests,
integrate completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions interact with the
phospholipid bilayer's hydrophobic region (Figure 5.2). Single-pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic
transmembrane segment that consists of 20–25 amino acids. Some span only part of the membrane—associating with a single
layer—while others stretch from one side to the other, and are exposed on either side. Up to 12 single protein segments comprise
some complex proteins, which are extensively folded and embedded in the membrane (Figure 5.5). This protein type has a
hydrophilic region or regions, and one or several mildly hydrophobic regions. This arrangement of protein regions orients the
protein alongside the phospholipids, with the protein's hydrophobic region adjacent to the phosopholipids' tails and the
protein's hydrophilic region or regions protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or extracellular fluid.
Figure5.5Integral membrane proteins may have one or more alpha-helices that span the membrane (examples 1 and 2), or they may have
beta-sheets that span the membrane (example 3). (credit: “Foobar”/Wikimedia Commons)

Membrane Fluidity
The membrane's mosaic characteristic helps to illustrate its nature. The integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as
separate but loosely attached molecules. These resemble the separate, multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float,
moving somewhat with respect to one another. The membrane is not like a balloon, however, that can expand and contract;
rather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in too much water. However, because of its mosaic nature, a
very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal
when one extracts the needle.
The membrane's mosaic characteristics explain some but not all of its fluidity. There are two other factors that help maintain this
fluid characteristic. One factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves. In their saturated form, the fatty acids in
phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. There are no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. This
results in tails that are relatively straight. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number of hydrogen
atoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. A double bond results in a bend in the carbon
string of approximately 30 degrees (Figure 5.3).
Thus, if decreasing temperatures compress saturated fatty acids with their straight tails, they press in on each other, making a
dense and fairly rigid membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the “kinks” in their tails elbow adjacent
phospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This “elbow room” helps to
maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids
would “freeze” or solidify. The membrane's relative fluidity is particularly important in a cold environment. A cold environment
usually compresses membranes comprised largely of saturated fatty acids, making them less fluid and more susceptible to
rupturing. Many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold environments by changing the proportion of
unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to lower temperature.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain why and how passive transport occurs
• Understand the osmosis and diffusion processes
• Define tonicity and its relevance to passive transport
Plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell, and prevent some harmful materials from entering
and some essential materials from leaving. In other words, plasma membranes areselectively permeable—they allow some
substances to pass through, but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself,
and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances. They must have a way of obtaining these
materials from extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have
special mechanisms that facilitate transport. Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy,
hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials. Red blood cells use some of their energy doing just that.
Most cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions between the cell's interior
and exterior, as well as on protein synthesis.
The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.Passive transportis a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not
require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of
higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A physical space in which there is a single substance concentration
range has aconcentration gradient.
Selective Permeability
Plasma membranes are asymmetric: the membrane's interior is not identical to its exterior. There is a considerable difference
between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a membrane. On the membrane's interior,
some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to cytoskeleton's fibers. There are peripheral proteins on the membrane's exterior
that bind extracellular matrix elements. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also on the plasma membrane's
exterior surface. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind required substances in the extracellular fluid. This adds
considerably to plasma membrane's selective nature (Figure 5.7).
Figure5.7The plasma membrane's exterior surface is not identical to its interior surface.
Recall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic: They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps move
some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Non-polar and lipid-soluble material with a low
molecular weight can easily slip through the membrane's hydrophobic lipid core. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A,
D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs and
hormones also gain easy entry into cells and readily transport themselves into the body’s tissues and organs. Oxygen and carbon

have a more difficult time passing through the denser medium. If the medium is less dense, diffusion increases. Because
cells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm, any increase in the cytoplasm’s density will inhibit the
movement of the materials. An example of this is a person experiencing dehydration. As the body’s cells lose water, the
diffusion rate decreases in the cytoplasm, and the cells’ functions deteriorate. Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this
effect. Dehydration frequently leads to unconsciousness and possibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within
the cells.
• Solubility: As we discussed earlier, nonpolar or lipid-soluble materials pass through plasma membranes more easily than
polar materials, allowing a faster diffusion rate.
• Surface area and plasma membrane thickness: Increased surface area increases the diffusion rate; whereas, a thicker
membrane reduces it.
• Distance travelled: The greater the distance that a substance must travel, the slower the diffusion rate. This places an upper
limitation on cell size. A large, spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot reach or leave the cell's center,
respectively. Therefore, cells must either be small in size, as in the case of many prokaryotes, or be flattened, as with many
single-celled eukaryotes.
A variation of diffusion is the process of filtration. In filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient through
a membrane. Sometimes pressure enhances the diffusion rate, causing the substances to filter more rapidly. This occurs in the
kidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, orsolutes, out of the blood
and into the renal tubules. The diffusion rate in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure. One of the effects of high
blood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which abnormally high pressure "squeezes through".
Facilitated transport
Infacilitated transport, or facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane
proteins. A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular
energy. However, these materials are polar molecule ions that the cell membrane's hydrophobic parts repel. Facilitated transport
proteins shield these materials from the membrane's repulsive force, allowing them to diffuse into the cell.
The transported material first attaches to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the plasma membrane's exterior surface. This
allows removal of material from the extracellular fluid that the cell needs. The substances then pass to specific integral proteins
that facilitate their passage. Some of these integral proteins are collections of beta-pleated sheets that form a pore or channel
through the phospholipid bilayer. Others are carrier proteins which bind with the substance and aid its diffusion through the
membrane.
Channels
The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport aretransport proteins, and they function as either channels for the
material or carriers. In both cases, they are transmembrane proteins. Channels are specific for the transported substance.
Channel proteinshave hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids. In addition, they have a
hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers (Figure 5.9). Passage
through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the plasma membrane's nonpolar central layer that would otherwise slow
or prevent their entry into the cell.Aquaporinsare channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very
high rate.

Figure5.10Some substances are able to move down their concentration gradient across the plasma membrane with the aid of carrier
proteins. Carrier proteins change shape as they move molecules across the membrane. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz
Villareal)
An example of this process occurs in the kidney. In one part, the kidney filters glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids that
the body requires. This filtrate, which includes glucose, then reabsorbs in another part of the kidney. Because there are only a
finite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the excess is not
transported and the body excretes this through urine. In a diabetic individual, the term is “spilling glucose into the urine.” A
different group of carrier proteins, glucose transport proteins, or GLUTs, are involved in transporting glucose and other hexose
sugars through plasma membranes within the body.
Channel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates. Channel proteins transport much more quickly than carrier
proteins. Channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second; whereas, carrier proteins
work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second.
Osmosis
Osmosisis the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across
the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration. While diffusion transports material across
membranes and within cells, osmosis transportsonly wateracross a membrane and the membrane limits the solutes' diffusion
in the water. Not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most prominently in
red blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules.
Mechanism
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low
concentration. An obvious question is what makes water move at all? Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane
separating the two sides or halves (Figure 5.11). On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are
different dissolved substance concentrations, orsolute, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the solute crossing the
membrane would balance concentrations on each side). If the solution's volume on both sides of the membrane is the same, but
the solute's concentrations are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.

many red blood cells have been destroyed. Do you think the solution the doctor injected was really isotonic?

Tonicity in Living Systems
In a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. In an isotonic condition, the relative solute and solvent
concentrations are equal on both membrane sides. There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change in the cell's
size. In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. If either the hypo- or hyper- condition goes to excess, the
cell’s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.
A red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane’s capability to expand. Remember, the
membrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules comprising it. If the cell swells, and the spaces
between the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.
In contrast, when excessive water amounts leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. This has the effect of
concentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. The cell’s
ability to function will be compromised and may also result in the cell's death.
Various living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis—a mechanism we call osmoregulation. Some organisms,
such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent cell lysis in a
hypotonic solution. The plasma membrane can only expand to the cell wall's limit, so the cell will not lyse. The cytoplasm in
plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available. This water
inflow produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the plant's cell walls (Figure 5.13). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports
the plant. Conversly, if you do not water the plant, the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell.
In this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible. However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall
and constricts the cytoplasm. We call thisplasmolysis. Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 5.14).

Active Transport
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Understand how electrochemical gradients affect ions
• Distinguish between primary active transport and secondary active transport
Active transportmechanisms require the cell’s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If a substance must
move into the cell against its concentration gradient—that is, if the substance's concentration inside the cell is greater than its
concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport
mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane. Other mechanisms transport much
larger molecules.
Electrochemical Gradient
We have discussed simple concentration gradients—a substance's differential concentrations across a space or a
membrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells
contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a
difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the
extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+) and lower
concentrations of sodium (Na+) than the extracellular fluid. Thus in a living cell, the concentration gradient of Na+tends to drive
it into the cell, and its electrical gradient (a positive ion) also drives it inward to the negatively charged interior. However, the
situation is more complex for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K+, a positive ion, also drives it into
the cell, but the concentration gradient of K+drives K+outof the cell (Figure 5.16). We call the combined concentration gradient
and electrical charge that affects an ion itselectrochemical gradient.

process. Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na+-K+ATPase, which carries sodium and potassium ions, and H+-K+
ATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins. Two other carrier proteins are
Ca2+ATPase and H+ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively. Both are pumps.
Figure5.17A uniporter carries one molecule or ion. A symporter carries two different molecules or ions, both in the same direction. An
antiporter also carries two different molecules or ions, but in different directions. (credit: modification of work by “Lupask”/Wikimedia
Commons)
Primary Active Transport
The primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows secondary active
transport to occur. The second transport method is still active because it depends on using energy as does primary transport
(Figure 5.18).
Figure5.18Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (electrogenic transport). (credit:
modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
One of the most important pumps in animal cells is the sodium-potassium pump (Na+-K+ATPase), which maintains the
electrochemical gradient (and the correct concentrations of Na+and K+) in living cells. The sodium-potassium pump moves K+
into the cell while moving Na+out at the same time, at a ratio of three Na+for every two K+ions moved in. The Na+-K+ATPase
exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to the cell's interior or exterior and its affinity for either sodium or potassium
ions. The process consists of the following six steps.
1. With the enzyme oriented towards the cell's interior, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions. Three ions bind to the
protein.
2. The protein carrier hydrolyzes ATP and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.
3. As a result, the carrier changes shape and reorients itself towards the membrane's exterior. The protein’s affinity for sodium
decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.
4. The shape change increases the carrier’s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the protein. Subsequently,
the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier.
5. With the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself towards the cell's

Bulk Transport
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe endocytosis, including phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis
• Understand the process of exocytosis
In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules
and particles (seeTable 5.2for examples). Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might
have correctly hypothesized that when a cell uptakes and releases large particles, it requires energy. A large particle, however,
cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy that the cell supplies.
Endocytosis
Endocytosisis a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a
cell. There are different endocytosis variations, but all share a common characteristic: the cell's plasma membrane invaginates,
forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle containing itself in a newly created
intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane.
Phagocytosis
Phagocytosis (the condition of “cell eating”) is the process by which a cell takes in large particles, such as other cells or relatively
large particles. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell, a neutrophil, will remove
the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which the neutrophil then destroys (Figure
5.20).
Figure5.20In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz
Villareal)
In preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the plasma membrane's inward-facing surface becomes coated with the protein
clathrin, which stabilizes this membrane's section. The membrane's coated portion then extends from the cell's body and
surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin
disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for breaking down the material in the newly formed
compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the vesicular contents' degradation have been extracted, the newly
formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal
membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.

Figure5.22In receptor-mediated endocytosis, the cell's uptake of substances targets a single type of substance that binds to the receptor
on the cell membrane's external surface. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
Inreceptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin attaches to the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic side. If a
compound's uptake is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be
removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. The failure of
receptor-mediated endocytosis causes some human diseases. For example, receptor mediated endocytosis removes low density
lipoprotein or LDL (or "bad" cholesterol) from the blood. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL
receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood,
because their cells cannot clear LDL particles.
Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally in the extracellular fluid into
the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites
that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.

Exocytosis
The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis.Exocytosisis the opposite of the processes we
discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped in a
membrane and fuses with the plasma membrane's interior. This fusion opens the membranous envelope on the cell's exterior,
and the waste material expels into the extracellular space (Figure 5.23). Other examples of cells releasing molecules via
exocytosis include extracellular matrix protein secretion and neurotransmitter secretion into the synaptic cleft by synaptic

currency we use to buy goods, cells use ATP molecules as energy currency to perform immediate work. The sugar (glucose) is
stored as starch or glycogen. Energy-storing polymers like these break down into glucose to supply ATP molecules.
Solar energy is required to synthesize a glucose molecule during the photosynthesis reactions. In photosynthesis, light energy
from the sun initially transforms into chemical energy that temporally stores itself in the energy carrier molecules ATP and
NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Photosynthesis later uses the stored energy in ATP and NADPH to
build one glucose molecule from six molecules of CO . This process is analogous to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire
2
energy for your body that you can use later in the day. Under ideal conditions, energy from 18 molecules of ATP is required to
synthesize one glucose molecule during photosynthesis reactions. Glucose molecules can also combine with and convert into
other sugar types. When an organism consumes sugars, glucose molecules eventually make their way into each organism's living
cell. Inside the cell, each sugar molecule breaks down through a complex series of chemical reactions. The goal of these reactions
is to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar molecules. The harvested energy makes high-energy ATP molecules, which
perform work, powering many chemical reactions in the cell. The amount of energy needed to make one glucose molecule from
six carbon dioxide molecules is 18 ATP molecules and 12 NADPH molecules (each one of which is energetically equivalent to
three ATP molecules), or a total of 54 molecule equivalents required for synthesizing one glucose molecule. This process is a
fundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.
Figure6.3Plants, like this oak tree and acorn, use energy from sunlight to make sugar and other organic molecules. Both plants and
animals (like this squirrel) use cellular respiration to derive energy from the organic molecules that plants originally produced. (credit

Metabolic Pathways
The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is
a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step, through a series
of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products. In the case of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic
pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. Scientists
call these two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing energy—anabolic (building) and
catabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively. Consequently, building (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism) comprise
metabolism.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define “energy”
• Explain the difference between kinetic and potential energy
• Discuss the concepts of free energy and activation energy
• Describe endergonic and exergonic reactions
We define energy as the ability to do work. As you’ve learned, energy exists in different forms. For example, electrical energy,
light energy, and heat energy are all different energy types. While these are all familiar energy types that one can see or feel,
there is another energy type that is much less tangible. Scientists associate this energy with something as simple as an object
above the ground. In order to appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand
more about the different energy types that exist in the physical world.
Energy Types
When an object is in motion, there is energy. For example, an airplane in flight produces considerable energy. This is because
moving objects are capable of enacting a change, or doing work. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can
do considerable damage to other objects. However, a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work.
Energy with objects in motion iskinetic energy. A speeding bullet, a walking person, rapid molecule movement in the air
(which produces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy.
What if we lift that same motionless wrecking ball two stories above a car with a crane? If the suspended wrecking ball is
unmoving, can we associate energy with it? The answer is yes. The suspended wrecking ball has associated energy that is
fundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion. This energy form results from thepotentialfor the
wrecking ball to do work. If we release the ball it would do work. Because this energy type refers to the potential to do work, we
call itpotential energy. Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way: As the wrecking ball
hangs motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy. Once it releases, its kinetic energy begins to increase
because it builds speed due to gravity. Simultaneously, as it nears the ground, it loses potential energy. Somewhere mid-fall it
has 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy. Just before it hits the ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy
and has near-maximal kinetic energy. Other examples of potential energy include water's energy held behind a dam (Figure 6.6),
or a person about to skydive from an airplane.

Free Energy
After learning that chemical reactions release energy when energy-storing bonds break, an important next question is how do
we quantify and express the chemical reactions with the associated energy? How can we compare the energy that releases from
one reaction to that of another reaction? We use a measurement offree energyto quantitate these energy transfers. Scientists
call this free energy Gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist who developed the
measurement. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve losing some energy in an
unusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. Gibbs free energy specifically refers to the energy that takes place with a
chemical reaction that is available after we account for entropy. In other words, Gibbs free energy is usable energy, or energy
that is available to do work.
Every chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta G (∆G). We can calculate the change in free energy for any
system that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction. To calculate ∆G, subtract the amount of energy lost to
entropy (denoted as ∆S) from the system's total energy change. Scientists call this total energy change in the systementhalpy
and we denote it as ∆H. The formula for calculating ∆G is as follows, where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in
Kelvin (degrees Celsius + 273):
We express a chemical reaction's standard free energy change as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product (either in
kilojoules or kilocalories, kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions. We
generally calculate standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions at pH 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees Celsius, and
100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively. Note that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions,
and so standard calculated ∆G values for biological reactions will be different inside the cell.
Endergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions
If energy releases during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number. In
other words, reactions that release energy have a ∆G < 0. A negative ∆G also means that the reaction's products have less free
energy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. Scientists call reactions that have a
negative ∆G and consequently release free energyexergonic reactions. Think:exergonic means energy isexiting the system. We
also refer to these reactions as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without adding energy into the system.
Understanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists, because
these reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. We must draw an important distinction between the term
spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a
spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. Rusting iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that
occurs slowly, little by little, over time.
If a chemical reaction requires an energy input rather than releasing energy, then the ∆G for that reaction will be a positive
value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, we can think of the reactions' products as
energy-storing molecules. We call these chemical reactionsendergonic reactions, and they are non-spontaneous. An
endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without adding free energy.
Let’s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. Remember that building complex
molecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. Therefore, the chemical reactions
involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. Alternatively the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler
molecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the rust example above, the sugar breakdown involves
spontaneous reactions, but these reactions do not occur instantaneously.Figure 6.8shows some other examples of endergonic
and exergonic reactions. Later sections will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous
reactions happen more efficiently.

Figure6.9Exergonic and endergonic reactions result in changes in Gibbs free energy. Exergonic reactions release energy. Endergonic
reactions require energy to proceed.
Activation Energy
There is another important concept that we must consider regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic
reactions require a small amount of energy input before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. These reactions
have a net release of energy, but still require some initial energy. Scientists call this small amount of energy input necessary for
all chemical reactions to occur theactivation energy(or free energy of activation) abbreviated as E (Figure 6.10).
A
Why would an energy-releasing, negative ∆G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the steps that
take place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds break and new ones form. For
example, when a glucose molecule breaks down, bonds between the molecule's carbon atoms break. Since these are energy-
storing bonds, they release energy when broken. However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule
must be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. This contorted state is the
transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason, reactant molecules do not last long in their transition
state, but very quickly proceed to the chemical reaction's next steps. Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a
given reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a
lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state
of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, E is always positive.
A
LINK TO LEARNING

From where does the activation energy that chemical reactants require come? The activation energy's required source to push
reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings.Heat energy(the total bond energy of reactants or products in
a chemical reaction) speeds up the molecule's motion, increasing the frequency and force with which they collide. It also moves
atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state. For this reason, heating a system will
cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently. Increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect.
Once reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition state, the reaction will
proceed.
The activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed. The higher the activation energy, the
slower the chemical reaction. The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. This reaction occurs slowly over
time because of its high E . Additionally, burning many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will take place at a negligible rate

unless sufficient heat from a spark overcomes their activation energy. However, once they begin to burn, the chemical reactions
release enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation energy for surrounding fuel molecules. Like these
reactions outside of cells, the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient
rates. In other words, in order for important cellular reactions to occur at appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time),
their activation energies must be lowered (Figure 6.10). Scientist refer to this as catalysis. This is a very good thing as far as living
cells are concerned. Important macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, store considerable energy, and their
breakdown is exergonic. If cellular temperatures alone provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome

The Laws of Thermodynamics
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the concept of entropy
• Explain the first and second laws of thermodynamics
Thermodynamicsrefers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its environment
relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside that system is the
surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water.
Energy transfers within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An
open system is one in which energy can transfer between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because
it can lose heat into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.
Biological organisms are open systems. Energy exchanges between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-
storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to
the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.
The First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this total amount of energy
is constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe.
Energy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may transfer from place to place or
transform into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place
around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from
natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of
converting sunlight energy into the chemical energy stored within organic molecules (Figure 6.2).Figure 6.11examples of energy
transformations.
The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform
into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well. Chemical energy stored within organic
molecules such as sugars and fats transforms through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within ATP molecules.
Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building

complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella, contracting muscle fibers to create
movement, and reproduction.
Figure6.11Here are two examples of energy transferring from one system to another and transformed from one form to another. Humans
can convert the chemical energy in food, like this ice cream cone, into kinetic energy (the energy of movement to ride a bicycle). Plants can
convert electromagnetic radiation (light energy) from the sun into chemical energy. (credit “ice cream”: modification of work by D. Sharon
Pruitt; credit “kids on bikes”: modification of work by Michelle Riggen-Ransom; credit “leaf”: modification of work by Cory Zanker)
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
A living cell’s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple. However, the second law
of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. None of the energy transfers that we have discussed,
along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some
amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, scientists define
heat energyas energy that transfers from one system to another that is not doing work. For example, when an airplane flies
through the air, it loses some of its energy as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air. This friction actually heats the
air by temporarily increasing air molecule speed. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic
reactions. This is good for warm-blooded creatures like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. Strictly
speaking, no energy transfer is completely efficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form.
An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (or randomness). The more energy that a system loses to
its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder
within a system asentropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 6.12). To better understand entropy, think
of a student’s bedroom. If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy. It would exist in a very
disordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the system, in the form of the student doing work and putting
everything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order. This state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a
car or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state. Left alone, a house's or car's
entropy gradually increases through rust and degradation. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy
as well. For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases, and as molecules at a high
concentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.
SCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION
Transfer of Energy and the Resulting Entropy
Set up a simple experiment to understand how energy transfers and how a change in entropy results.
1. Take a block of ice. This is water in solid form, so it has a high structural order. This means that the molecules cannot move
very much and are in a fixed position. The ice's temperature is 0°C. As a result, the system's entropy is low.
2. Allow the ice to melt at room temperature. What is the state of molecules in the liquid water now? How did the energy
transfer take place? Is the system's entropy higher or lower? Why?
3. Heat the water to its boiling point. What happens to the system's entropy when the water is heated?
Think of all physical systems of in this way: Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to maintain
themselves in a state of low entropy. As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through chemical
reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient. They also produce
waste and by-products that are not useful energy sources. This process increases the entropy of the system’s surroundings. Since

ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain ATP's role as the cellular energy currency
• Describe how energy releases through ATP hydrolysis
Even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed. However, consider
endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than their
reactants. Within the cell, from where does energy to power such reactions come? The answer lies with an energy-supplying
molecule scientists calladenosine triphosphate, orATP. This is a small, relatively simple molecule (Figure 6.13), but within
some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. Think of
this molecule as the cells' primary energy currency in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for
things they need. ATP powers the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.
Figure6.13ATP is the cell's primary energy currency. It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups attached.
As its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups (Figure 6.13).
Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. The three phosphate
groups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are alpha, beta, and gamma. Together, these chemical groups
constitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state. Both

## Section 143.2
• ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate 167
bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds) that, when broken, release sufficient
energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and
third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups. These bonds are “high-
energy” because the products of such bond breaking—adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group
(P)—have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP and a water molecule. Because this reaction takes place using a
i
water molecule, it is a hydrolysis reaction. In other words, ATP hydrolyzes into ADP in the following reaction:
Like most chemical reactions, ATP to ADP hydrolysis is reversible. The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP + P. Cells rely
i
on ATP regeneration just as people rely on regenerating spent money through some sort of income. Since ATP hydrolysis
releases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy. This equation expresses ATP formation:
Two prominent questions remain with regard to using ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy releases with ATP
hydrolysis, and how does that free energy do cellular work? The calculated ∆G for the hydrolysis of one ATP mole into ADP and P
i
is −7.3 kcal/mole (−30.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under standard conditions, one would expect a different value
exists under cellular conditions. In fact, the ∆G for one ATP mole's hydrolysis in a living cell is almost double the value at
standard conditions: –14 kcal/mol (−57 kJ/mol).
ATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + P, and the
i
free energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question we posed above discusses how ATP hydrolysis
energy release performs work inside the cell. This depends on a strategy scientists call energy coupling. Cells couple the ATP
hydrolysis' exergonic reaction allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane
ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+pump) drives sodium out of
the cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 6.14). A large percentage of a cell’s ATP powers this pump, because cellular processes
bring considerable sodium into the cell and potassium out of it. The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations
of sodium and potassium. In order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K+ions), one
ATP molecule must hydrolyze. When ATP hydrolyzes, its gamma phosphate does not simply float away, but it actually transfers
onto the pump protein. Scientists call this process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule phosphorylation. As with most
ATP hydrolysis cases, a phosphate from ATP transfers onto another molecule. In a phosphorylated state, the Na+/K+pump has
more free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows it to release Na+to the cell's outside.
It then binds extracellular K+, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump.
This phosphate release triggers the K+to release to the cell's inside. Essentially, the energy released from the ATP hydrolysis
couples with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na+and K+ions. ATP performs cellular work using this basic
form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.

Enzymes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the role of enzymes in metabolic pathways
• Explain how enzymes function as molecular catalysts
• Discuss enzyme regulation by various factors
A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions
are enzymes. Almost all enzymes are proteins, comprised of amino acid chains, and they perform the critical task of lowering
the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell. Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules, and holding
them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily. It is important
to remember that enzymes do not change the reaction's ∆G. In other words, they do not change whether a reaction is exergonic
(spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the reactants' or products' free energy. They only reduce the
activation energy required to reach the transition state (Figure 6.15).
Figure6.15Enzymes lower the reaction's activation energy but do not change the reaction's free energy.
Enzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity
The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme’ssubstrates. There may be one or more substrates, depending

on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single-reactant substrate breaks down into multiple products. In
others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction, both become
modified, and leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is the enzyme’s
active site. This is where the “action” happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues
(also side chains, or R groups) within the active site. Different properties characterize each residue. These can be large or small,
weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of
amino acid residues, their positions, sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within
the active site. This specific environment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates). Due to
this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition
state and the active site), enzymes are known for their specificity. The “best fit” results from the shape and the amino acid
functional group’s attraction to the substrate. There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each
chemical reaction; however, there is flexibility as well.
The fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject to
local enviromental influences. It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates,
enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect
chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures will
eventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, todenature, a process that changes the substance's natural
properties. Likewise, the local environment's pH can also affect enzyme function. Active site amino acid residues have their own
acidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis. These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that can impair the way
substrate molecules bind. Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with temperature, extreme
environmental pH values (acidic or basic) can cause enzymes to denature.
Induced Fit and Enzyme Function
For many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple “lock-and-key” fashion. This model
asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports a
more refined view scientists callinduced fit(Figure 6.16). This model expands upon the lock-and-key model by describing a
more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes
a mild shift in the enzyme’s structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and the substrate's
transition state. This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme’s ability to catalyze its reaction.
LINK TO LEARNING
View an induced fit animation atthis website(http://openstax.org/l/hexokinase).
When an enzyme binds its substrate, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex lowers the reaction's activation
energy and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that
involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. The appropriate region (atoms
and bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the other molecule's appropriate region with which it must react. Another way in
which enzymes promote substrate reaction is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur.
Certain chemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar environment. The chemical properties that
emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an
enzyme’s specific substrates to react.
You have learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or slightly
contorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform. Enzymatic action can aid this process. The
enzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bond-
breaking, helping to reach the transition state. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical
reaction itself. The amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with
substrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. In these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will
always return to its original state at the reaction's completion. One of enzymes' hallmark properties is that they remain
ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, it releases its product(s).

• Enzymes 171
Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the
enzyme's affinity for its substrate. This type of inhibition is anallosteric inhibition(Figure 6.18). More than one polypeptide
comprise most allosterically regulated enzymes, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric
inhibitor binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits change slightly such that they bind their substrates with
less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from
the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme’s active site(s) for its substrate(s).
Figure6.18Allosteric inhibitors modify the enzyme's active site so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented. In contrast, allosteric
activators modify the enzyme's active site so that the affinity for the substrate increases.

Drug Discovery by Looking for Inhibitors of Key Enzymes in Specific Pathways

Enzyme Compartmentalization
In eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles. This allows for yet
another level of regulation of enzyme activity. Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes are sometimes housed
separately along with their substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions. Examples of this sort of enzyme
regulation based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take
place exclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in digesting cellular debris and foreign materials, located
within lysosomes.
Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways
Molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. However, a major question remains: What are these molecules and from
where do they come? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as you have learned. What other
molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive
inhibition? The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles. Some include pharmaceutical and non-
pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. Perhaps the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory
molecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are cellular metabolic reaction products themselves. In a most efficient and
elegant way, cells have evolved to use their own reactions' products for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.Feedback
inhibitioninvolves using a reaction product to regulate its own further production (Figure 6.21). The cell responds to the
abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions. Such reaction products may
inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms that we described above.
Figure6.21Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions that multiple enzymes catalyze. Feedback inhibition, where the pathway's end
product inhibits an upstream step, is an important regulatory mechanism in cells.
Producing both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition. Additionally, ATP is an allosteric
regulator of some of the enzymes involved in sugar's catabolic breakdown, the process that produces ATP. In this way, when ATP
is abundant, the cell can prevent its further production. Remember that ATP is an unstable molecule that can spontaneously
dissociate into ADP. If too much ATP were present in a cell, much of it would go to waste. Alternatively, ADP serves as a positive
allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that ATP inhibits. Thus, when relative ADP levels are
high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through sugar catabolism.

Energy in Living Systems
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the importance of electrons in the transfer of energy in living systems
• Explain how ATP is used by cells as an energy source
Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are
combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions, which occur at the same time. An oxidation reaction
strips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a
reduction reaction. Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are
called oxidation reduction reactions, orredox reactions.
Electrons and Energy
The removal of an electron from a molecule (oxidizing it), results in a decrease in potential energy in the
oxidized compound. The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom) does not remain unbonded,
however, in the cytoplasm of a cell. Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the
second compound.The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy
from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second
compound (the reduced compound).The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most
of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The
transfer of energy in the form of high-energy electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an
incremental fashion—in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on
the extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking
the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.
Electron Carriers
In living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: they bind and carry high-energy
electrons between compounds in biochemical pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are
derived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced
(that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
(Figure 7.2) is derived from vitamin B, niacin. NAD+is the oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the
3
reduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton (which together are the
equivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron). Note that if a compound has an “H” on it, it is
generally reduced (e.g., NADH is the reduced form of NAD).
NAD+can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation:
When electrons are added to a compound,it is reduced. A compound that reduces another is called a
reducing agent. In the above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD+is reduced to NADH. When
electrons are removed from a compound,it is oxidized. A compound that oxidizes another is called an
oxidizing agent. In the above equation, NAD+is an oxidizing agent, and RH is oxidized to R.
Similarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is derived from vitamin B , also called riboflavin. Its reduced
2
form is FADH . A second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group. Both NAD+and FAD+
2
are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic
reactions and photosynthesis in plants.

Figure7.2The oxidized form of the electron carrier (NAD+) is shown on the left, and the reduced form (NADH) is shown on the right. The
nitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD+.
ATP in Living Systems
A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell,
which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to
handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells
accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the “energy currency” of the cell, and,
like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a
rechargeable battery.
When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The energy is used to do
work by the cell, usually when the released phosphate binds to another molecule, thereby activating it. For example, in the
mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the active
transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that
functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions
against their electrochemical gradients.
ATP Structure and Function
At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a
ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (Figure 7.3). Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA, and AMP is one of the
nucleotides in RNA. The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine
diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosinetriphosphate (ATP).

Oxidative Phosphorylation
Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process, chemiosmosis,
which takes place in mitochondria (Figure 7.5) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell.
Chemiosmosis, a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism, is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during
glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight. The
production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is calledoxidative phosphorylationbecause of the involvement of oxygen
in the process.

CAREER CONNECTION
Mitochondrial Disease Physician
What happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? This may happen in mitochondrial
diseases, which are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or
mitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. In type 2 diabetes, for
instance, the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of
respiration. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and
loss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases.
Identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession
requires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be
board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations
devoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited
Metabolic Disorders.

Glycolysis
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the overall result in terms of molecules produced during the chemical breakdown of glucose by
glycolysis
• Compare the output of glycolysis in terms of ATP molecules and NADH molecules produced
As you have read, nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar glucose.Glycolysisis the
first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. In fact, nearly all living organisms carry out
glycolysis as part of their metabolism. The process does not use oxygen directly and therefore is termedanaerobic. Glycolysis
takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways. One
method is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. The
other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins calledGLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. These
transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.
Glycolysis begins with the six-carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-
carbon sugar calledpyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. The first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose
molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-
carbon molecules. The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and
NADH—remember: this is the reduced form of NAD.
First Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Requiring Steps)
Step 1. The first step in glycolysis (Figure 7.6) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the
phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate, producing
glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from
continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will
not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.
Step 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers,
fructose-6-phosphate (this isomer has a phosphate attached at the location of the sixth carbon of the ring). Anisomeraseis an
enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (This change from phosphoglucose to
phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.)
Step 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A second
ATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In this pathway,
phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less active when ADP
levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is “sufficient” ATP in the system, the pathway slows down. This
is a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.
Step 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis
employs an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone phosphate
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
Step 5. In the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
Thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. At this point in the pathway, there is a net
investment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.

## Section 155.2
• Glycolysis 185
Figure7.6The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose, which is then split into two three-carbon
molecules.
Second Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Releasing Steps)
So far, glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules. Both of these
molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP
molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even higher-
energy NADH molecules.
Step 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 7.7) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy
electrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD+, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition
of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Note that the second phosphate group does not require
another ATP molecule.
Figure7.7The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two NADH and four ATP
molecules per glucose.
Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the
oxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD+. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD+in order to keep this
step going. If NAD+is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in the system, the
NADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will
be used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of
NADH to NAD+.
Step 7. In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction),
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP. (This is an example of
substrate-level phosphorylation.) A carbonyl group on the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a carboxyl group, and
3-phosphoglycerate is formed.
Step 8. In the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second

Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how a circular pathway, such as the citric acid cycle, fundamentally differs from a linear biochemical
pathway, such as glycolysis
• Describe how pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, is prepared for entry into the citric acid cycle
If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of
glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, which are the sites of cellular respiration. There, pyruvate is transformed into
an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting compound is
calledacetyl CoA. CoA is derived from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid. Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but
its major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.
Breakdown of Pyruvate
In order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. The conversion is a
three-step process (Figure 7.8).
Step 1.A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium. This
reaction creates a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase). We should note that this is
the first of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed. (This step proceeds twice because there aretwo
pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis for every molecule of glucose metabolized anaerobically; thus, two of the six
carbons will have been removed at the end of both steps.)
Step 2.The hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group, and the electrons are picked up by NAD+, forming NADH. The
high-energy electrons from NADH will be used later to generate ATP.

## Section 156.2
• Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle 187
Step 3.The enzyme-bound acetyl group is transferred to CoA, producing a molecule of acetyl CoA.
Figure7.8Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix, a multienzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA. In the process, carbon
dioxide is released, and one molecule of NADH is formed.
Note that during the second stage of glucose metabolism, whenever a carbon atom is removed, it is bound to two oxygen atoms,
producing carbon dioxide, one of the major end products of cellular respiration.
Acetyl CoA to CO
2
In the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl (2C) group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate, a six-
carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began
as a glucose molecule and release the remaining four CO molecules. This single pathway is called by different names: thecitric
2
acid cycle(for the first intermediate formed—citric acid, or citrate—when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), theTCA cycle
(because citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and theKrebs cycle, after Hans Krebs, who first identified
the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.
Citric Acid Cycle
Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria. Almost all of the
enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is
embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: the last part of
the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox, dehydration,
hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP, and the reduced carriers
NADH and FADH (Figure 7.9).This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and FADH produced must transfer
2 2
their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen.If this transfer does not occur, the oxidation steps of
the citric acid cycle also do not occur. Note that the citric acid cycle produces very little ATP directly and does not directly
consume oxygen.

NAD+to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO molecules. Alpha-ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a
2
succinyl group is the product of step four. CoA binds with the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA. The enzyme that catalyzes
step four is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.
Step 5. In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is used in
substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine triphosphate
(GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in
which they are found. One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal muscle. This form
produces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver.
This form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more restricted. In particular, protein
synthesis primarily uses GTP.
Step 6. Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to FAD,
reducing it to FADH . (Note: the energy contained in the electrons of these hydrogens is insufficient to reduce NAD+but
2
adequate to reduce FAD.) Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron
transport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner
membrane of the mitochondrion.
Step 7. Water is added by hydrolysis to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle
regenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is then produced in the process.

View an animation of the citric acid cyclehere(http://openstax.org/l/krebs_cycle).
Products of the Citric Acid Cycle
Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose
molecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the
most recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all
six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each turn of the cycle
forms three NADH molecules and one FADH molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration,
2
the electron transport chain, to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate
compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing nonessential amino acids; therefore, the cycle isamphibolic(both
catabolic and anabolic).

## Section 157.2
Oxidative Phosphorylation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how electrons move through the electron transport chain and explain what happens to their energy
levels during this process
• Explain how a proton (H+) gradient is established and maintained by the electron transport chain
You have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolism—glycolysis and the citric acid cycle—that generate ATP. Most of
the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these pathways. Instead, it
is derived from a process that begins by moving electrons through a series of electron carriers that undergo redox reactions. This
process causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the intermembranous space. Therefore, a concentration gradient forms in
which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the intermembranous space into the mitochondrial matrix by passing through ATP synthase.
The current of hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP, producing ATP.
Electron Transport Chain
The electron transport chain (Figure 7.10) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose metabolism
that uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plant tissues (typically through stomata), as well as into fungi
and bacteria; however, in animals, oxygen enters the body through a variety of respiratory systems. Electron transport is a series
of redox reactions that resembles a relay race or bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the
next, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce molecular oxygen and, along with associated protons, produces
water. There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV inFigure 7.10, and the aggregation of these four

Complex IV
The fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a. This complex contains two heme groups (one in each of the
3
two cytochromes, a, and a) and three copper ions (a pair of Cu and one Cu in cytochrome a). The cytochromes hold an oxygen
3 A B 3
molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced by the gain of two electrons. The
reduced oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (H O). The removal of the
2
hydrogen ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient that forms the foundation for the process of chemiosmosis.
Chemiosmosis
In chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons)
across the mitochondrial membrane. The uneven distribution of H+ions across the membrane establishes both concentration
and electrical gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions’ positive charge and their aggregation
on one side of the membrane.
If the membrane were continuously open to simple diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across
into the matrix, driven by the concentrations producing their electrochemical gradient. Recall that many ions cannot diffuse
through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid membranes without the aid of ion channels. Similarly, hydrogen ions in the
matrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane by an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase
(Figure 7.11). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down
their electrochemical gradient. The turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP,
forming ATP,using the potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient.

Metabolism without Oxygen
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the fundamental difference between anaerobic cellular respiration and fermentation
• Describe the type of fermentation that readily occurs in animal cells and the conditions that initiate that
fermentation
In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O . If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be
2
produced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH to the electron transport chain. If aerobic
2
respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to
continue. How is this done? Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use an
organic molecule to regenerate NAD+from NADH are collectively referred to asfermentation. In contrast, some living systems
use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. Both methods are calledanaerobic cellular respiration, in which
organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.
Anaerobic Cellular Respiration
Certain prokaryotes, including some species in the domains Bacteria and Archaea, use anaerobic respiration. For example, a
group of archaeans called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH. These microorganisms are found
in soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep. Similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria, most of which are
anaerobic (Figure 7.13), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate NAD+from NADH.
Figure7.13The green color seen in these coastal waters is from an eruption of hydrogen sulfide–producing bacteria. These anaerobic,
sulfate-reducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in the water. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Jeff

Lactic Acid Fermentation
The fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria, such as those in yogurt, is lactic acid fermentation (Figure 7.14).
This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells, which do not have mitochondria, and in skeletal
muscle that has an insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of
fatigue). In muscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation, and when the lactic acid loses a
hydrogen, the resulting lactate is brought to the liver for further metabolism. The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation

Other Types of Fermentation
Other fermentation methods take place in bacteria. We should note that many prokaryotes arefacultativelyanaerobic. This
means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of free oxygen. Certain
prokaryotes, such asClostridia, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen.
Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure. We should also note that all forms of fermentation,
except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the
fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. Various methods of
fermentation are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD+for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without
these pathways, this step would not occur, and ATP could not be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.

## Section 160.2
Connections of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Lipid Metabolic
Pathways
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the ways in which carbohydrate metabolic pathways, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle interrelate
with protein and lipid metabolic pathways
• Explain why metabolic pathways are not considered closed systems
You have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells. But living things consume organic
compounds other than glucose for food. How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your cells? This happens because all of the
catabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways
(seeFigure 7.17). Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porous and interconnecting—that is, substances enter from other
pathways, and intermediates leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems! Many of the substrates,
intermediates, and products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.
Connections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism
Glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is an energy storage molecule in animals. When there is adequate ATP present, excess glucose is
stored as glycogen in both liver and muscle cells. The glycogen will be hydrolyzed into glucose 1-phosphate monomers (G-1-P) if
blood sugar levels drop. The presence of glycogen as a source of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer period of time
during exercise. Glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in
both muscle and liver cells, and this product enters the glycolytic pathway.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Pathways of Photosynthesis and Cellular Metabolism
The processes of photosynthesis and cellular metabolism consist of several very complex pathways. It is generally thought that
the first cells arose in an aqueous environment—a “soup” of nutrients—possibly on the surface of some porous clays, perhaps in
warm marine environments. If these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily, it follows that the cells
would begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived as they shifted the nutrients into the components of
their own bodies. This hypothetical situation would have resulted in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist
by using the nutrients that remained in their environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials upon which they
could survive. Selection would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the nutrients to which they had
access.
An early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun’s energy using water as a source of hydrogen atoms, but this
pathway did not produce free oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis). (Another type of anoxygenic photosynthesis did not produce
free oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen ions; instead, it used materials such as hydrogen sulfide and
consequently produced sulfur). It is thought that glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars
being produced but that these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. The development of
glycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials
spontaneously accumulating in the “primeval soup.” A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of electrons and
hydrogen and generated free oxygen. Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated, but not before the oxygen released
oxidized metals in the ocean and created a “rust” layer in the sediment, permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic
photosynthesizers. Living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to
evolve. When the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally
able to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric
acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.

Regulation of Cellular Respiration
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how feedback inhibition would affect the production of an intermediate or product in a pathway
• Identify the mechanism that controls the rate of the transport of electrons through the electron transport chain
Cellular respirationmust be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of ATP. The cell also must
generate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of macromolecules. Without
controls, metabolic reactions would quickly come to a standstill as the forward and backward reactions reached a state of
equilibrium. Resources would be used inappropriately. A cell does not need the maximum amount of ATP that it can make all
the time: At times, the cell needs to shunt some of the intermediates to pathways for amino acid, protein, glycogen, lipid, and
nucleic acid production. In short, the cell needs to control its metabolism.
Regulatory Mechanisms
A variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration. Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism.
Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using theGLUT (glucose transporter) proteinsthat transport glucose (Figure 7.18).

## Section 162.1
• Regulation of Cellular Respiration 199
Figure7.19The glycolysis pathway is primarily regulated at the three key enzymatic steps (1, 3, and 10) as indicated. Note that the first
two steps that are regulated occur early in the pathway and involve hydrolysis of ATP.
Phosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis. High levels of ATP or citrate or a lower, more acidic pH
decreases the enzyme’s activity. An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle.
Fermentation, with its production of organic acids such as lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell;
however, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells.
The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or converted into
the amino acid alanine. If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme is inhibited. The enzyme’s
activity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase. (Recall that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in
the first half of glycolysis.) The regulation of pyruvate kinase involves phosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase), resulting in
a less-active enzyme. Dephosphorylation by a phosphatase reactivates it. Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP (a negative
allosteric effect).
If more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. If
either acetyl groups or NADH accumulates, there is less need for the reaction, and the rate decreases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is
also regulated by phosphorylation: a kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates it. The
kinase and the phosphatase are also regulated.
Citric Acid Cycle
The citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of NADH
(Figure 7.9). These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase andα-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. When adequate ATP and NADH
levels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease. When more ATP is needed, as reflected in rising ADP levels, the rate
increases. Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl CoA—a subsequent intermediate in
the cycle—causing a decrease in activity. A decrease in the rate of operation of the pathway at this point is not necessarily
negative, as the increased levels of theα-ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be used by the cell for amino acid
(glutamate) synthesis.
Electron Transport Chain
Specific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition, but the rate of electron transport
through the pathway is affected by the levels of ADP and ATP. Greater ATP consumption by a cell is indicated by a buildup of

Overview of Photosynthesis
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain the significance of photosynthesis to other living organisms
• Describe the main structures involved in photosynthesis
• Identify the substrates and products of photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. It is the only biological
process that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and converts it into chemical compounds
(carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. It is also a source of oxygen necessary for
many living organisms. In brief, the energy of sunlight is “captured” to energize electrons, whose energy is
then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds?
The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy
captured and stored by photosynthesis 350 to 200 million years ago during the Carboniferous Period.
Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing
photosynthesis (Figure 8.2). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called
photoautotrophs(literally, “self-feeders using light”). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most
other bacteria, are termedheterotrophs(“other feeders”), because they must rely on the sugars produced by
photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize
sugars, not by using sunlight’s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds. For
this reason, they are referred to aschemoautotrophs.
Figure8.2Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds
via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous
areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e)
thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem
surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopuses that derive
energy from the bacteria. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; credit b:

The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight’s energy. After all, a lizard sunning
itself on a cold day can use the sun’s energy to warm up in a process calledbehavioral thermoregulation. In
contrast, photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way tostore the energy from solar radiation (the

“photo-” part) to energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “-synthesis” part).Those carbohydrates are
the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99
percent of Earth’s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 8.3), the wolf is at the end of an
energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer,
and finally to the wolf.
Figure8.3The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. The predator that eats these
deer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed. (credit: modification of work
by Steve VanRiper, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)
Main Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires specific wavelengths of visible sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in
energy), and water as substrates (Figure 8.4). After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), as well as simple carbohydrate molecules (high in energy) that can then be converted into
glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon
that all living things need to survive.
Figure8.4Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates. Oxygen is generated as a
waste product of photosynthesis.

## Section 170.1
• Overview of Photosynthesis 209
The Two Parts of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the
light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical
energy. In thelight-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the
assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a
reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, however, several enzymes of the
light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store
the energy: These are referred to asenergy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to
light-independent reactions can be thought of as “full” because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the “empty”
energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy.Figure 8.7illustrates the components inside the
chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.
Figure8.7Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Light-dependent reactions, which take
place in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, uses energy
derived from these compounds to make G3P from CO2.

How can light energy be used to make food? When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all
other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis, light
energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build basic carbohydrate molecules (Figure 8.9).
However, autotrophs only use a few specific wavelengths of sunlight.

What Is Light Energy?
The sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy in a spectrum from very short gamma rays to
very long radio waves). Humans can see only a tiny fraction of this energy, which we refer to as “visible light.” The manner in
which solar energy travels is described as waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its
wavelength(shorter wavelengths are more powerful than longer wavelengths)—the distance between consecutive crest points of
a wave. Therefore, a single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough
(Figure 8.10).
Figure8.10The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points of similar position (two crests or two troughs)
along the wave.
Visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars. Scientists
differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum. Theelectromagnetic
spectrumis the range of all possible frequencies of radiation (Figure 8.11). The difference between wavelengths relates to the
amount of energy carried by them.

Figure8.12The colors of visible light do not carry the same amount of energy. Violet has the shortest wavelength and therefore carries the
most energy, whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy. (credit: modification of work by NASA)
Understanding Pigments
Different kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only specific wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or
transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear a mixture of the reflected or transmitted light colors.
Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has
multiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls:a,b,canddand a related molecule found in prokaryotes
calledbacteriochlorophyll.Chlorophyllaandchlorophyllbare found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the
following discussion.
With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit—such as the
red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (β-carotene)—are used as
advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis,carotenoidsfunction as photosynthetic pigments that are very
efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are
required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage.
Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat.
Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light: This is termed the
absorption spectrum. The graph inFigure 8.13shows the absorption spectra for chlorophylla, chlorophyllb, and a type of
carotenoid pigment called β-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks
and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyllaabsorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible
spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. Carotenoids
absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.

## Section 173.1
• The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis 215
How Light-Dependent Reactions Work
The overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.
This chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules. The light-dependent
reactions are depicted inFigure 8.15. Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce NADPH and ATP. The
numbering of the photosystems is derived from the order in which they were discovered, not in the order of the transfer of
electrons.
Figure8.15A photosystem consists of 1) a light-harvesting complex and 2) a reaction center. Pigments in the light-harvesting complex
pass light energy to two special chlorophyllamolecules in the reaction center. The light excites an electron from the chlorophyllapair,
which passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must then be replaced. In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from
the splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste product. In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron
transport chain discussed below.
The actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called aphotosystem, two
types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane:photosystem II(PSII) andphotosystem I(PSI) (Figure 8.16).
The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron supply) and what they
reduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons).
Both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number ofantenna proteinsto which the chlorophyll molecules are bound
surround thereaction centerwhere the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by thelight-harvesting
complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a
mixture of 300 to 400 chlorophyllaandbmolecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. The absorption of a single
photonor distinct quantity or “packet” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state. In short, the

mitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by
aerobic organisms to support respiration.
As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. This energy is used to move hydrogen
atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by
splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP in a later step. Because the electrons have
lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna.
That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (calledP700). P700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to NADP+to
form NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce
NADP+into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly
equal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine-tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast’s constantly
changing energy needs.
Generating an Energy Carrier: ATP
As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the
thylakoid lumen creates aconcentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the
thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of
cellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling
each other.
To release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the
thylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by the
hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (Figure
8.16). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an
area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure of the thylakoid.

## Section 174.2
Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the Calvin cycle
• Define carbon fixation
• Explain how photosynthesis works in the energy cycle of all living organisms
After the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the cell
has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. The products of the light-dependent
reactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-independent
reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive almost indefinitely. The carbohydrate molecules made
will have a backbone of carbon atoms. But where does the carbon come from? It comes from carbon dioxide—the gas that is a
waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.
The Calvin Cycle
In plants, carbon dioxide (CO ) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular
2
spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast—the site
2
of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names associated with them. Another
term, theCalvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle. Others call it the
Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery. The most outdated name is “dark
reaction,” because light is not directly required (Figure 8.17). However, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it
implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors
no longer use it.

is regenerated so that the cycle can continue. Only one carbon dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle must be completed
three times to produce a single three-carbon G3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule.
Which of the following statements is true?
a. In photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. G3P and water are products.
b. In photosynthesis, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide are reactants. G3P and oxygen are products.
c. In photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. RuBP and oxygen are products.
d. In photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. G3P and oxygen are products.
RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO and RuBP. For each CO molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules of
2 2
another compound 3-phospho glyceric acid (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle
involves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the
same, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 C atoms from 3CO + 15 C atoms from 3RuBP = 18 C atoms
2
in 6 molecules of 3-PGA). This process is calledcarbonfixation, because CO is “fixed” from an inorganic form into organic
2
molecules.
Stage 2: Reduction
ATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. (Recall that areductionis the
gain of an electron by an atom or molecule.) Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is released with
the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost,
converting it into NADP+. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and re-
energized.
Stage 3: Regeneration
Interestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the
formation of other compounds needed by the plant. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it
takes three “turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three
turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate
RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these
2
regeneration reactions.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Photosynthesis
During the evolution of photosynthesis, a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis that involves only one
photosystem and is typically anoxygenic (does not generate oxygen) into modern oxygenic (does generate oxygen)
photosynthesis, employing two photosystems. This modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organisms—from giant
tropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cells—and the process and components of this photosynthesis remain
largely the same. Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of ATP

While the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single-celled
organisms communicate with each other. Yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells
for reproduction. Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes
called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. The ability of
cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the
evolution of multicellular organisms. The efficient and relatively error-free function of communication
systems is vital for all life as we know it.

Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe four types of signaling mechanisms found in multicellular organisms
• Compare internal receptors with cell-surface receptors
• Recognize the relationship between a ligand’s structure and its mechanism of action
There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells. Communication between cells is called
intercellular signaling, and communication within a cell is calledintracellular signaling. An easy way to
remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes:inter-means "between" (for
example, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) andintra-means "inside" (as in intravenous).
Chemical signals are released bysignaling cellsin the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules
called ligands. Aligandis a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal
in the process. Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules. Ligands interact with proteins in
target cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also calledreceptors.
Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that
typically binds only that ligand.
Forms of Signaling
There are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: paracrine signaling,
endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions (Figure 9.2). The main
difference between the different categories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the
organism to reach the target cell. We should note here that not all cells are affected by the same signals.
Figure9.2In chemical signaling, a cell may target itself (autocrine signaling), a cell connected by gap junctions, a
nearby cell (paracrine signaling), or a distant cell (endocrine signaling). Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells,
endocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell.
Signaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.

• Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors 229
Paracrine Signaling
Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are calledparacrine signals. Paracrine signals move by diffusion
through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short period of time. In
order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by
neighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly
diffuse through the intracellular space if released again.
One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell
body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which
transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called
a synapse. Asynaptic signalis a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by
fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the
next cell by the release of chemical ligands calledneurotransmittersfrom the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The
neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances (20–40 nanometers) between nerve cells, which are called
chemical synapses(Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an
immediate response, such as, "Take your hand off the stove!"
When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target
cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are
degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to
respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.
Figure9.3The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell—called the synaptic gap—is very small and allows for rapid
diffusion of the neurotransmitter. Enzymes in the synapatic gap degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.
Endocrine Signaling
Signals from distant cells are calledendocrine signals, and they originate fromendocrine cells. (In the body, many endocrine
cells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.) These types of
signals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect. The ligands released in endocrine signaling are called
hormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions some distance away.
Hormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively slow
way to move throughout the body. Because of their form of transport, hormones become diluted and are present in low
concentrations when they act on their target cells. This is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations of

Figure9.4Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors in the
cytoplasm. Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.
Cell-Surface Receptors
Cell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that
bind to external ligand molecules. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, through
which an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not
have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are
specific to individual cell types.
Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a
malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor
molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.
Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain called theextracellular domain, a
hydrophobic membrane-spanning region called a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The size
and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
How Viruses Recognize a Host
Unlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to sustain metabolic life.
Some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell enclosing DNA or RNA. To reproduce, viruses must invade a living
cell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular apparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?
Viruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human influenza (flu) binds
specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical differences in the cell-surface receptors
among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for example, humans) often cannot infect another species (for
example, chickens).
However, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral reproduction can occur
rapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in newly produced viruses; these changes mean
that the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new
host. Such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus
with new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings
where animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.1Once a virus jumps the former "species barrier"
to a new host, it can spread quickly. Scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging viruses) closely in the hope that

Figure9.6Heterotrimeric G-proteins have three subunits:α,β, andγ. When a signaling molecule binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor in
the plasma membrane, a GDP molecule associated with theαsubunit is exchanged for GTP. Theβandγsubunits dissociate from theα
subunit, and a cellular response is triggered either by theαsubunit or the dissociatedβγpair. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the
signal.
G-protein-linked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in maintaining health.
Bacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific G-protein-linked receptor function, leading
to illnesses such as pertussis, botulism, and cholera. In cholera (Figure 9.7), for example, the water-borne bacteriumVibrio
choleraeproduces a toxin, choleragen, that binds to cells lining the small intestine. The toxin then enters these intestinal cells,
where it modifies a G-protein that controls the opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously active,
resulting in large losses of fluids from the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result.

Figure9.8A receptor tyrosine kinase is an enzyme-linked receptor with a single helical transmembrane region, and extracellular and
intracellular domains. Binding of a signaling molecule to the extracellular domain causes the receptor to dimerize. Tyrosine residues on the
intracellular domain are then autophosphorylated, triggering a downstream cellular response. The signal is terminated by a phosphatase
that removes the phosphates from the phosphotyrosine residues.
HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase. In 30 percent of human breast cancers, HER2 is permanently activated, resulting in
unregulated cell division. Lapatinib, a drug used to treat breast cancer, inhibits HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase

proteins to small ions like calcium (Ca2+).

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how the binding of a ligand initiates signal transduction throughout a cell
• Recognize the role of phosphorylation in the transmission of intracellular signals
• Evaluate the role of second messengers in signal transmission
Once a ligand binds to a receptor, the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm. Continuation of a
signal in this manner is calledsignal transduction. Signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors, which cannot
interact with most components of the cell such as DNA. Only internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the
nucleus to initiate protein synthesis.
When a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor’s intracellular domain.

## Section 187.2
• Propagation of the Signal 237
Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the
receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand causes
dimerizationof the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. A
dimeris a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. The binding of the receptors in this
manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.
Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway
After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor’s intracellular components sets off a chain of
events that is called asignaling pathway, sometimes called a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second
messengers–enzymes–and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that
eventually leads to a change in the cell’s environment (Figure 9.10), such as an increase in metabolism or specific gene
expression. The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in a river. Interactions that occur before a
certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called downstream events.

Figure9.11In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO4 -3) is added to residues of the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine.
Second Messengers
Second messengersare small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling
molecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain
cellular proteins.
Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because
ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously remove it by using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). For signaling purposes,
Ca2+is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling
occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular
storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the
increase in Ca2+varies and depends on the cell type involved. For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+signaling leads to
the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca2+leads to muscle contractions.
Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types iscyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme
adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme calledcAMP-
dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine
residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target
proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells.
Figure9.12This diagram shows the mechanism for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP serves as a second messenger to activate or
inactivate proteins within the cell. Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called phosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP.

Response to the Signal
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how signaling pathways direct protein expression, cellular metabolism, and cell growth
• Identify the function of PKC in signal transduction pathways
• Recognize the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance of a healthy organism
Inside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to directly affect the cell’s DNA and protein-producing
machinery. Using signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety of effects on the cell. The
results of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the external and internal
conditions. A small sampling of responses is described below.
Gene Expression
Some signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of RNA. Others regulate the translation of proteins from mRNA.
An example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK. The MAPK/ERK pathway (also known
as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of
the cell to the nuclear DNA. ERK is activated in a phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds the EGF
receptor (seeFigure 9.10). Upon phosphorylation, ERK enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that, in turn, regulates
protein translation (Figure 9.14).
Access for free at openstax.org.

--- Page 261 ---

## Section 189.2
• Response to the Signal 241
Figure9.14ERK is a MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated. ERK phosphorylates MNK1, which in turn
phosphorylates eIF-4E, an elongation initiation factor that, with other initiation factors, is associated with mRNA. When eIF-4E becomes
phosphorylated, the mRNA unfolds, allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin. (SeeFigure 9.10for the phosphorylation pathway
that activates ERK.)
Another mechanism of gene regulation involves PKC, which can interact with is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. Aninhibitor
is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the inhibitor is a
protein called Iκ-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-κB. (The symbol κ represents the Greek letter kappa.) When Iκ-B
is bound to NF-κB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when Iκ-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer
bind NF-κB, and NF-κB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In this case, the effect of
phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.
Increase in Cellular Metabolism
The result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation of β-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by
adrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone
(produced by the adrenal gland located on top of the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP
activates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation of
glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP)
that catabolizes glycogen into its constituent glucose monomers. (Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for
short-term storage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme,
glycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready pool of
glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen, thus
preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in
response to a sudden surge of adrenaline—the “fight or flight” reflex.
Cell Growth
Cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals
from other cells. The ligands that promote cell growth are calledgrowth factors. Most growth factors bind to cell-surface
receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activation
of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP kinase pathway described

between the toes, which apoptosis will eliminate before the mouse reaches its full gestational age at 27 days. (credit: modification of work
by Michal Mañas)
Termination of the Signal Cascade
The aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just as
important as the initiation of a signal. One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so that it
can no longer access its receptor. One reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-lasting
events is because they bind carrier proteins. These proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but they also
protect the hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes.
Inside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades. For example,
phosphatasesare enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called
dephosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into AMP byphosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is
reversed by the Ca2+pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell.

Signaling in Single-Celled Organisms
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how single-celled yeasts use cell signaling to communicate with one another
• Relate the role of quorum sensing to the ability of some bacteria to form biofilms
Within-cell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues, such as nutrient levels. Some single-celled organisms
also release molecules to signal to each other.
Signaling in Yeast
Yeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface
receptor signals in multicellular organisms. Budding yeasts (Figure 9.16) are able to participate in a process that is similar to
sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining to form a
diploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain). In order to find another haploid
yeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule calledmating factor. When mating factor binds
to cell-surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling
cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins that are similar to G-proteins.

that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development, differentiation,
and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms.
Because yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms are ideal for studying
signaling cascades. Yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than humans or other multicellular animals.
Therefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to study, although they contain similar counterparts to human

• Cell Division 255
Figure10.3There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell. The condensed chromosomes are viewed
within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell during mitosis (also called karyokinesis or nuclear division) and spread out on a slide (right),
and artificially arranged according to length (left); an arrangement like this is called a karyotype. In this image, the chromosomes were
exposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of the different chromosomes. A method of staining called“chromosome painting”
employs fluorescent dyes that highlight chromosomes in different colors. (credit: National Human Genome Project/NIH)
Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the different genes (alleles)
themselves are not identical, although they code for the same traits such as “hair color.” The variation of individuals within a
species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of
nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human
chromosome that code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies
of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by the two alleles of the marker gene that
are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each
(for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB, AO, or BO.
Apparently minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found
within a species, but even though they seem minor, these traits may be connected with the expression of other traits as of yet
unknown. However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the difference
is much less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome
uniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the X
and Y chromosomes are different.
Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction
If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus were laid out end-to-end, it would measure approximately two
meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm! Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells
lined up to equal one meter), DNA must betightly packagedto fit in the cell’s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily
accessible for the genes to be expressed. For this reason, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes
during certain stages of the cell cycle. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.
In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eighthistone proteinsat regular
intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4). The DNA-histone complex is called chromatin. The beadlike,
histone DNA complex is called anucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in
this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in
contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix.
The second level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them coil into a 30-nm chromatin fiber.
This coiling furthercondensesthe chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form.
In the third level of compaction, a variety offibrous proteinsis used to “pack the chromatin.” These fibrous proteins also ensure
that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any

## Section 200.2
• The Cell Cycle 257
Thecell cycleis an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on
the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication,
and nuclear and cytoplasmic division that ultimately produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases:
interphase and the mitotic phase (Figure 10.5). Duringinterphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During themitotic
phase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell cytoplasm is typically partitioned by a third
process of the cell cycle calledcytokinesis. We should note, however, that interphase and mitosis (karyokinesis) may take place
without cytokinesis, in which case cells with multiple nuclei (multinucleate cells) are produced.
Figure10.5The cell cycle in multicellular organisms consists of interphase and the mitotic phase. During interphase, the cell grows and the
nuclear DNA is duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are
segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Following mitosis, the cytoplasm is usually divided as well by cytokinesis, resulting in two
genetically identical daughter cells.
Interphase
During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move
from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are
calledG, S, and G.
1 2
G Phase (First Gap)
1
The first stage of interphase is called theG phase(first gap) because, from a microscopic point of view, little change is visible.
1
However, during the G stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of
1
chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of
replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.
S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)
Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In theS phase, DNA replication
can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules—sister chromatids—that
are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is also duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes of
homologous chromosomes will give rise to themitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes
during mitosis. For example, roughly at the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes are associated with a pair of rod-like
objects, thecentrioles, which are positioned at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. We should note,

the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure.
This fissure is called thecleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is
cleaved in two (Figure 10.8).
In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates
enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell.
During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form aphragmoplast(a vesicular structure) at the
metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called acell plate. As
more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose
that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma
membrane on either side of the new cell wall (Figure 10.8).
Figure10.8During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate. The ring contracts, forming a cleavage
furrow, which divides the cell in two. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former metaphase plate, forming a phragmoplast. A cell
plate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows from the center toward the cell walls, and the membranes of the
vesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides the cell in two.

Background: A prepared microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections will show cells arrested in various stages of the

The length of the cell cycle is highly variable, even within the cells of a single organism. In humans, the frequency of cell turnover
ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and to an entire
human lifetime spent in G by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells.

The G Checkpoint
1
TheG checkpointdetermines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed. The G checkpoint, also called the
1 1
restriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division process. External influences, such
as growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves and cell size,
1
there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed
1
to progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance
into G and await further signals when conditions improve.
0
The G Checkpoint
2
The G checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. As at the G checkpoint, cell size and
2 1
protein reserves are assessed. However, the most important role of the G checkpoint is to ensure that all of the chromosomes
2
have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA,
the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.
The M Checkpoint
The M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle
checkpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. Because
the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores
of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell.

animation of the cell cycle.
Regulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle
In addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle.
These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative
regulation). Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other regulatory
proteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one
mechanism controls the same event. However, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and
possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.
Positive Regulation of the Cell Cycle
Two groups of proteins, calledcyclinsandcyclin-dependent kinases(Cdks), are termed positive regulators. They are responsible
for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell
cycle in a predictable pattern (Figure 10.11). Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and
internal signals. After the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are
degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes, as shown inFigure 10.11below.

--- Page 286 ---
266

# Chapter 205

## Section 205.1
• Control of the Cell Cycle 267
Figure10.12Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and thus activate other
proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind to a cyclin protein and then be
phosphorylated by another kinase.
Because the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are largely based on thetiming of the cell cycleand not on specific events,
regulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes. Without a specific
concentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.
Although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several
other mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. These mechanisms
essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that prevent the full
activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell-
cycle event. The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor
monitors is completed.

Cancer and the Cell Cycle
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell growth
• Understand how proto-oncogenes are normal cell genes that, when mutated, become oncogenes
• Describe how tumor suppressors function
• Explain how mutant tumor suppressors cause cancer
Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the redundancy
and overlapping levels of cell-cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell-cycle checkpoint
surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell-cycle controls are fully
functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA
nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start
when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction.
The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to
cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow
subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the
daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage.
Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled
growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (“-oma”) can result.
Proto-oncogenes
The genes that code for the positive cell-cycle regulators are calledproto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that,
when mutated in certain ways, becomeoncogenes—genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen
to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a
less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing
the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce,
the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that
increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered
with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter
cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the
organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells may
accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.
The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell-cycle
regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell-cycle checkpoints. An
oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell-cycle progression.
Tumor Suppressor Genes
Like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell-cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous.
Tumor suppressor genesare segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that, when
activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-understood tumor
suppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell-cycle progression until certain events are completed.
A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem. Tumor
suppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash!
Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than 50 percent of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in
light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors present
1
in the genomic DNA (Figure 10.14). Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to
signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected. At this point, a functional p53
will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged version of p53 found in cancer
cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.

Prokaryotic Cell Division
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the process of binary fission in prokaryotes
• Explain how FtsZ and tubulin proteins are examples of homology
Prokaryotes, such as bacteria, produce daughter cells by binary fission. For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only
method to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of
daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.
To achieve the outcome of cloned offspring, certain steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated
into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the cellular machinery to sustain
life. As we’ve seen with bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell
division is simplified. Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no true nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the
multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell. This type of cell division is calledbinary (prokaryotic) fission.
Binary Fission
Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process is a less complicated and much more rapid process
than cell division in eukaryotes. As a review of the general information on cell division we discussed at the beginning of this
chapter, recall that the single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria occupies a specific location, the nucleoid region, within the
cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a
compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are,
however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.
The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of
replication, theorigin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the
DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are
formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates,
the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the
elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein calledFtsZ
(short for “filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z”) directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring
triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A
septumis formed between the daughter nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When
the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.

and various cytoskeletal components. In addition, both FtsZ and tubulin employ the same energy source, GTP (guanosine
triphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures.
FtsZ and tubulin are considered to be homologous structures derived from common evolutionary origins. In this example, FtsZ
is the ancestor protein to tubulin (an evolutionarily derived protein). While both proteins are found in extant organisms, tubulin
function has evolved and diversified tremendously since evolving from its FtsZ prokaryotic origin. A survey of mitotic assembly
components found in present-day unicellular eukaryotes reveals crucial intermediary steps to the complex membrane-enclosed

multicellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method—sexual reproduction. This highly
evolved method involves the production by parents of two haploid cells and the fusion of two haploid
cells to form a single, genetically recombined diploid cell—a genetically unique organism. Haploid cells
that are part of the sexual reproductive cycle are produced by a type of cell division calledmeiosis. Sexual
reproduction, involving both meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may
account for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms,
both multicellular and unicellular, can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to
reproduce.
In most plants and animals, through thousands of rounds of mitotic cell division, diploid cells (whether
produced by asexual or sexual reproduction) will develop into an adult organism.

The Process of Meiosis
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis, and the differences between the first
and second meiotic divisions
• Describe the cellular events that take place during meiosis
• Explain the differences between meiosis and mitosis
• Explain the mechanisms within the meiotic process that produce genetic variation among
the haploid gametes
Sexual reproduction requires the union of two specialized cells, calledgametes, each of which contains one
set of chromosomes. When gametes unite, they form azygote, or fertilized egg that contains two sets of
chromosomes. (Note: Cells that contain one set of chromosomes are calledhaploid; cells containing two sets
of chromosomes are calleddiploid.) If the reproductive cycle is to continue for any sexually reproducing
species, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets to produce haploid
gametes; otherwise, the number of chromosome sets will double with every future round of fertilization.
Therefore, sexual reproduction requires a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets by
half.
Most animals and plants and many unicellular organisms are diploid and therefore have two sets of
chromosomes. In eachsomatic cellof the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes
or reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, calledhomologous
chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical
locations along their lengths. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from
each parent.
Meiosisis thenuclear divisionthat forms haploid cells from diploid cells, and it employs many of the same
cellular mechanisms as mitosis. However, as you have learned,mitosisproduces daughter cells whose nuclei
are genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei
are at the same “ploidy level”—diploid in the case of most multicellular most animals. Plants use mitosis to
grow as sporophytes, and to grow and produce eggs and sperm as gametophytes; so they use mitosis for
both haploid and diploid cells (as well as for all other ploidies). In meiosis, the starting nucleus is always
diploid and the daughter nuclei that result are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number,
meiosis consists of one round of chromosome replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division.
Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the
same stage names are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and
the stages are designated with a “I” or a “II.” Thus,meiosis Iis the first round of meiotic division and
consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Likewise,Meiosis II(during which the second round of
meiotic division takes place) includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.
Meiosis I
Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of G, S, and G phases, which are nearly identical to the
1 2
phases preceding mitosis. The G phase (the “first gap phase”) is focused on cell growth. During the S

phase—the second phase of interphase—the cell copies orreplicatesthe DNA of the chromosomes. Finally,
in the G phase (the “second gap phase”) the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.
2
During DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical
copies—sister chromatidsthat are held together at the centromere bycohesinproteins, which hold the
chromatids together until anaphase II.
Prophase I
Early in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly with a microscope, the homologous
chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins
to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair closer together. Recall
that in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. Thesynaptonemal complex, a lattice of
proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads outward

## Section 215.2
• The Process of Meiosis 281
to cover the entire length of the chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is calledsynapsis. In
synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The
synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between homologous nonsister chromatids—a
process calledcrossing over. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange aschiasmata(singular = chiasma) (Figure
11.2).
In humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not completely homologous (that is, most of their genes differ), there
is a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal
complex develops only between the regions of homology.
Figure11.2Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are bound tightly together
and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin proteins at the centromere.
Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies calledrecombination nodules. These
assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process ofcrossover—or genetic
recombination—between the nonsister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule, the double-stranded DNA of each
chromatid is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the nonsister chromatids. As prophase I
progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the synaptonemal
complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The
chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome.
There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but
there may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between
homologous pairs is removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3). These
pairs are calledtetradsbecause the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.
The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between
homologous nonsister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a
paternal chromosome. When a recombinant sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one
parent and some DNA from the other parent. The recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes
that did not exist before the crossover. Crossover events can occur almost anywhere along the length of the synapsed
chromosomes. Different cells undergoing meiosis will therefore produce different recombinant chromatids, with varying
combinations of maternal and parental genes. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect,
exchanging segments of DNA to produce genetically recombined chromosomes.

one from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother.
The father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. Every cell of the multicellular offspring
has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. In prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form
the tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase
plate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome,
the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Thus, any maternally inherited chromosome may face either
pole. Likewise, any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole.The orientation of each tetrad is independent of
the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.
This event—therandom(orindependent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate—is the second
mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the
tetrads is different. The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There are two
possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2nin a diploid cell,
wherenis the number of chromosomes per haploid set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million
(223) possible genetically-distinct gametes just from the random alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. This
number does not include the variability that was previously produced by crossing over between the nonsister chromatids. Given
these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic
composition (Figure 11.4).
To summarize, meiosis I creates genetically diverse gametes in two ways. First, during prophase I, crossover events between the
nonsister chromatids of each homologous pair of chromosomes generate recombinant chromatids with new combinations of
maternal and paternal genes. Second, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase plate produces unique combinations
of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.
Figure11.4Random, independent assortment during metaphase I can be demonstrated by considering a cell with a set of two

## Section 217.1
• The Process of Meiosis 285
Figure11.5The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I, microtubules attach to the
fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the midline of the cell (the
metaphase plate) in metaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes separate. In prometaphase II, microtubules attach to the
kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids are arranged at the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II. In anaphase II, the
sister chromatids separate.
Telophase II and Cytokinesis
The chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes. If the
parent cell was diploid, as is most commonly the case, then cytokinesis now separates the two cells into four unique haploid
cells. The cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and
because of the recombination of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during
crossover. The entire process of meiosis is outlined inFigure 11.6.

diploid.
The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In
meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs physically meet and are bound together with the synaptonemal complex.
Following this, the chromosomes develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between nonsister chromatids. In the end, the
chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate as tetrads—with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to
each kinetochore of a homolog to form a tetrad.All of these events occur only in meiosis I.
When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy level—the
number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus—has been reduced from two to one. For this reason, meiosis I is referred
to as areductional division. There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.
Meiosis II is analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the
metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase II, as in
mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid—now referred to as a chromosome—is pulled to one pole
while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two
products of each individual meiosis II division would be identical (as in mitosis). Instead, they are different because there has
always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division because although there are fewer
copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.
Figure11.7Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one cycle of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two nuclear divisions. The
four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells resulting from mitosis are diploid and

Sexual Reproduction
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain that meiosis and sexual reproduction are highly evolved traits
• Identify variation among offspring as a potential evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction
• Describe the three different life-cycle types among sexually reproducing multicellular organisms.
Sexual reproduction was likely an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells. It appears to have been
very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually and, in many animals, it is the only mode of
reproduction. And yet, scientists also recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating
offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. If the parent organism is successfully occupying a
habitat, offspring with the same traits should be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can
produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or by producing eggs asexually.
These methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a
solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable
of reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so hypothetically an asexual

population could grow twice as fast.
However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why are meiosis and
sexual reproductive strategies so common? These are important (and as yet unanswered) questions in biology, even though they
have been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the 20th century. There are several possible explanations,
one of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and
reproduction of the population. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an
otherwise similar asexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. Mutations
that take place during the formation of germ cell lines are also the ultimate source of variation in sexually reproducing
organisms. However, in contrast to mutation during asexual reproduction, the mutations during sexual reproduction can be
continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are
mixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
The Red Queen Hypothesis
Genetic variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary, even under seemingly stable
environmental conditions? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.3The concept was named
in reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's book,Through the Looking-Glass.
All speciescoevolve(evolve together) with other organisms. For example, predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve
with their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species a reproductive edge over close competitors,
predators, parasites, or even prey. However, survival of any given genotype or phenotype in a population is dependent on the
reproductive fitness of other genotypes or phenotypes within a given species. The only method that will allow a coevolving
species to maintain its own share of the resources is to alsocontinually improve itsfitness(the capacity of the members to
produce more reproductively viable offspring relative to others within a species). As one species gains an advantage, this
increases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species
progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a
mechanism to improve rapidly. Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen’s catchphrase was, “It takes all the
running you can do to stay in the same place.” This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species.
Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms
Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexuallife cycles. What happens between these two events depends on the organism’s
“reproductive strategy.” The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid
gametes, restores the diploid condition. Some organisms have a multicellular diploid stage that is most obvious and only
produce haploid reproductive cells. Animals, including humans, have this type of life cycle. Other organisms, such as fungi, have
a multicellular haploid stage that is most obvious. Plants and some algae have alternation of generations, in which they have
multicellular diploid and haploid life stages that are apparent to different degrees depending on the group.
Nearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are
the gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, calledgerm cells, are produced within the
gonads (such as the testes and ovaries). Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the germ cell line and meiosis to produce
haploid gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life
stage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (Figure
11.8).

multicellular haploid organism by mitosis. Above, different mating hyphae types (denoted as + and –) join to form a zygospore through

If a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus mating type, will it still be able to reproduce?
The third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is a blend of the haploid-dominant and diploid-dominant
extremes. Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life
cycle. The haploid multicellular plants are calledgametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells. Meiosis is
not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes is already
haploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise
to a diploid multicellular plant called asporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce
haploid spores. The spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes (Figure 11.10).

Figure12.2Johann Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics.
Johann Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) (Figure 12.2) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith.
As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic.
Supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and
university levels. In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in
honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primarymodel system(a system with
convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems). In
1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural
History Society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted from parents to offspring independently of
other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he published his work,Experiments in Plant
Hybridization,1in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn.
Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which believed, incorrectly, that the
process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical
appearance in offspring. Theblending theory of inheritanceasserted that the original parental traits were
lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case. This hypothetical
process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation.Continuous variation
results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to
be a “blend” of their parents’ traits.
Instead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes
(specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to asdiscontinuous variation. Mendel’s choice of
these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor

were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on. In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the
monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific
contributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by
scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.
Mendel’s Model System
Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea,Pisum sativum, to study inheritance. This species naturally self-
fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after
pollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or “true-breeding,” pea plants. These are plants
that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the
appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to
maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large
quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about
simply by chance.
Mendelian Crosses
Mendel performedhybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea,
which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one
variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the male gametes (sperm) to
the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below. To
prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel painstakingly removed
all of the anthers from the plant’s flowers before they had a chance to mature.
Plants used in first-generation crosses were calledP , or parental generation one (Figure 12.3). After each cross, Mendel

confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical.
Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with
white flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross,Mendel found that 100 percent of the Fhybrid
1
generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time (the blending theory) would have predicted the hybrid flowers
to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental
traits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel’s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F

generation had completely disappeared.
Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F plants to self-fertilize and found that, of

flower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white
flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait.
This is called areciprocal cross—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the
respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics Mendel examined, the F and F
1 2
generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F
1
generation only to reappear in the F generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 (Table 12.1).

Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into
expressed and latent traits. He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits.Dominant traitsare those that are
inherited unchanged in a hybridization.Recessive traitsbecome latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization. The
recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower
trait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that the recessive trait

Of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of
coming up heads. By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (D ) x (P ) = (1/

6) x (1/2) or 1/12 (Table 12.3). Notice the word “and” in the description of the probability. The “and” is a signal to apply the product
rule. For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits
(for example, yellow and round) in the F progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each
2
characteristic, as shown here:
On the other hand, thesum ruleof probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come
about by more than one pathway. The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of
two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word “or” in the description of the
probability. The “or” indicates that you should apply the sum rule. In this case, let’s imagine you are flipping a penny (P) and a
quarter (Q). What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? This outcome can be achieved by
two cases: the penny may be heads (P ) and the quarter may be tails (Q ), or the quarter may be heads (Q ) and the penny may

be tails (P ). Either case fulfills the outcome. By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining one head and one tail as

[(P ) × (Q )] + [(Q ) × (P )] = [(1/2) × (1/2)] + [(1/2) × (1/2)] = 1/2 (Table 12.3). You should also notice that we used the product rule to

Characteristics and Traits
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems
• Develop a Punnett square to calculate the expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a
monohybrid cross
• Explain the purpose and methods of a test cross
• Identify non-Mendelian inheritance patterns such as incomplete dominance, codominance, recessive lethals,
multiple alleles, and sex linkage
Physical characteristics are expressed through genes carried on chromosomes. The genetic makeup of peas consists of two
similar, or homologous, copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Each pair of homologous chromosomes has the
same linear order of genes. In other words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each chromosome. The
same is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals. Diploid organisms produce haploid gametes, which contain one
copy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote.
For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not
encode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on
homologous chromosomes are calledalleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is
common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.
Phenotypes and Genotypes
Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable
traits expressed by an organism are referred to as itsphenotype. An organism’s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both
physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called itsgenotype. Mendel’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the
difference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had
green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically
1
identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods
was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F offspring. Therefore, the F plants must have been genotypically
2 1
different from the parent with yellow pods.
The P plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that
1
arehomozygousat a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes. Mendel’s
parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P plants with
1
contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring wereheterozygousfor the contrasting trait, meaning that their
genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.
Dominant and Recessive Alleles
Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F heterozygous offspring were identical to
1
one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles
was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was
referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous
chromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous
organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). The recessive allele will only be
observed in homozygous recessive individuals (Table 12.4).

Several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles. For the purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes using the
first letter of the gene’s corresponding dominant trait. For example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea plant’s flower color, so
the flower-color gene would be abbreviated asV(note that it is customary to italicize gene designations). Furthermore, we will
use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. Therefore, we would refer to the
genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers asVV, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers
asvv, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers asVv.
The Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross
When fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a
monohybridcross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids. Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving
contrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of his results in F and F generations, Mendel postulated that each parent
1 2
in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit
factors was equally likely.
To demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds. The
dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes wereYYfor the plants with yellow seeds andyyfor the plants
with green seeds, respectively. APunnett square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be drawn that applies
the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies. To prepare
a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other
parent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the combinations of egg and sperm are
made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote,
or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be
determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be
inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case,
only one genotype is possible. All offspring areYyand have yellow seeds (Figure 12.4).

this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an
organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then
all F offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (Figure 12.5). Alternatively, if the dominant expressing
1
organism is a heterozygote, the F offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes (Figure 12.5). The
1
test cross further validates Mendel’s postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure12.5A test cross can be performed to determine whether an organism expressing a dominant trait is a homozygote or a
heterozygote.
In pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkled peas (r). You do a test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled peas
(genotyperr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas. You end up with three plants, all which have round peas.
From this data, can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous? If the round pea parent
plant is heterozygous, what is the probability that a random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be round?
Many human diseases are genetically inherited. A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive
genetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on to
his or her offspring. Of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. Instead, geneticists usepedigree
analysisto study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases (Figure 12.6).

Codominance
A variation on incomplete dominance iscodominance, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously
expressed in the heterozygote. An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans. The M and N alleles are
expressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (LMLMandLNLN) express
either the M or the N allele, and heterozygotes (LMLN) express both alleles equally. In a self-cross between heterozygotes
expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. However, the 1:2:1 genotypic
ratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.
Multiple Alleles
Mendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, could exist for a given gene. We now know that this is an
oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple
alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when many alleles
exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as thewild
type(often abbreviated “+”); this is considered the standard or norm. All other phenotypes or genotypes are consideredvariants
of this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele.
An example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits (Figure 12.8). Here, four alleles exist for thecgene. The wild-type version,
C+C+, is expressed as brown fur. The chinchilla phenotype,cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped white fur. The Himalayan
phenotype,chch, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere. Finally, the albino, or “colorless” phenotype,cc, is
expressed as white fur. In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist. In this case, the wild-type allele is dominant
over all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and Himalayan is dominant over albino. This
hierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote offspring.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite
Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, includingAnopheles gambiae
(Figure 12.10a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia.Plasmodium falciparum
andP. vivaxare the most common causative agents of malaria, andP. falciparumis the most deadly (Figure 12.10b).When
promptly and correctly treated,P. falciparummalaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world,
the parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by
geographic region.
Figure12.10The (a)Anopheles gambiae, or African malaria mosquito, acts as a vector in the transmission to humans of the malaria-
causing parasite (b)Plasmodium falciparum, here visualized using false-color transmission electron microscopy. (credit a: James D.
Gathany; credit b: Ute Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
In Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America,P. falciparumhas developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine,
mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.P. falciparum, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to
humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of thedhpsgene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are
associated with each of these alleles. Being haploid,P. falciparumneeds only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.
In Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of thedhpsgene are localized to different geographic regions. This is a
common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other
P. falciparumisolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where
this drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers
within an infection cycle,P. falciparumevolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of
commonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug
combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.2
X-Linked Traits
In humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes. The
sex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns
among non-sex chromosomes, orautosomes. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a
homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains
a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and
contains many fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome, but not on the Y chromosome, it is
said to beX-linked.
Eye color inDrosophilawas one of the first X-linked traits to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X
chromosome in 1910. Like humans,Drosophilamales have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX. In flies, the wild-type
eye color is red (XW) and it is dominant to white eye color (Xw) (Figure 12.11). Because of the location of the eye-color gene,
reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said to behemizygous, because they have only one allele
for any X-linked characteristic. Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males.
Drosophilamales lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be XWY or XwY. In contrast,
females have two allele copies of this gene and can be XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.

Figure12.12Punnett square analysis is used to determine the ratio of offspring from a cross between a red-eyed male fruit fly and a white-
eyed female fruit fly.
What ratio of offspring would result from a cross between a white-eyed male and a female that is heterozygous for red eye color?
Discoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics. When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked
trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express the trait, as
they will inherit their father's Y chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color blindness,
hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and
may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half
of their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.
In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather
than the male. This is the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in which they
are hemizygous.
Human Sex-linked Disorders
Sex-linkage studies in Morgan’s laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding X-linked recessive disorders in
humans, which include red-green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia. Because human males need to inherit only
one recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must inherit
recessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. When they inherit one recessive X-linked
mutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected. Carrier
females can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X chromosomes.
However, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute
the recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait (Figure 12.13). Although some Y-
linked recessive disorders exist, typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not transmitted to
subsequent generations.

heterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele (Hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease. However, the onset of
Huntington’s disease may not occur until age 40, at which point the afflicted persons may have already passed the allele to 50
percent of their offspring.

Laws of Inheritance
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain Mendel’s law of segregation and independent assortment in terms of genetics and the events of
meiosis
• Use the forked-line method and the probability rules to calculate the probability of genotypes and phenotypes
from multiple gene crosses
• Explain the effect of linkage and recombination on gamete genotypes
• Explain the phenotypic outcomes of epistatic effects between genes
Mendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four postulates, some of which are sometimes called “laws,”
that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms. As you have learned, more complex
extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws summarize the
2
basics of classical genetics.
Pairs of Unit Factors, or Genes
Mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the
dissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively. After he crossed peas with
contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F generation, Mendel deduced that hereditary factors
2
must be inherited as discrete units. This finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended in the
offspring.

Figure12.16This dihybrid cross of pea plants involves the genes for seed color and texture.
In pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p) and yellow peas (Y) are dominant to green peas (y). What are
the possible genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea plants? How many squares do you need to do a
Punnett square analysis of this cross?
For the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either anRallele or anrallele along with either a
Yallele or ayallele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which anrallele sorted would be equally likely
to contain either aYallele or ayallele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when theYyRrheterozygote
is self-crossed, as follows:YR,Yr,yR, andyr. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square (Figure
12.16) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3
round/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 12.16). These are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we
performed the crosses with a large enough sample size.
Because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios,
characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and considering only
seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F generation offspring would be round, and
2
one quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the F offspring
2
would be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can
apply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F offspring is expected to be (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16, and the
2
proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16. These proportions are identical to those obtained
using a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of
these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) × (1/
4) = 3/16.
The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR) parents
would yield the same F and F offspring as in theYYRRxyyrrcross.
1 2
The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line up
in random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the
genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.

genetics. Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive pattern, several
generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations (Table 12.5). To
apply these rules, first you must determinen, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two
alleles each). For example, a cross betweenAaBbandAaBbheterozygotes has annof 2. In contrast, a cross betweenAABband

Linked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment
Although all of Mendel’s pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know that some
allele combinations are not inherited independently of each other. Genes that are located on separate non-homologous
chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized
linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced bylinkage, in which
genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. However,
because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave
independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let’s consider the biological basis of gene linkage and
recombination.
Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. The alleles may differ on homologous chromosome
pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes
replicate and synapse. Like genes on the homologs align with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes
exchange linear segments of genetic material (Figure 12.18). This process is calledrecombination, or crossover, and it is a
common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. Instead, the result
of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given chromosome,
several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.

dihybrid crosses.
Question: What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?
Background: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in which you can
cultivate thousands of pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of traits: tall plants with
inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. Before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing organs
from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. Upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed
by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the tall/inflated plants.
Hypothesis: Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents are crossed,
all of the F offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf
1
and constricted traits, respectively. A self-cross of the F heterozygotes results in 2,000 F progeny.
1 2
Test the hypothesis: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each
expected to be 3:1. The tall/dwarf trait pair is calledT/t, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designatedI/i. Each member of
the F generation therefore has a genotype ofTtIi. Construct a grid analogous toFigure 12.16, in which you cross twoTtIi
1
individuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits:TI,Ti,tI, orti, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of
offspring genotypes. Because theTandIalleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the

proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Notice from the grid that when
considering the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios.

the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted alleles.
Test the hypothesis: You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross the offspring. For best results, this is repeated with
hundreds or even thousands of pea plants. What special precautions should be taken in the crosses and in growing the plants?
Analyze your data: You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F generation: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/constricted, 888

dwarf/inflated, and 300 dwarf/constricted. Reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if they are consistent with Mendelian
laws.
Form a conclusion: Were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio? Do the results support the prediction? What
might be observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate randomly into gametes? Try to imagine growing
that many pea plants, and consider the potential for experimental error. For instance, what would happen if it was extremely
windy one day?

Figure12.20In mice, the mottled agouti coat color (A) is dominant to a solid coloration, such as black or gray. A gene at a separate locus
(C) is responsible for pigment production. The recessivecallele does not produce pigment, and a mouse with the homozygous recessivecc
genotype is albino regardless of the allele present at theAlocus. Thus, theCgene is epistatic to theAgene.
Epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is expressed
in this way. Homozygous recessive expression of theWgene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or heterozygous
expression of theYgene (YYorYy) generates yellow fruit, and thewwyygenotype produces green fruit. However, if a dominant
copy of theWgene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless
of theYalleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy×WwYy) would produce offspring with a phenotypic
ratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.
Finally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same
phenotype. In the shepherd’s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by two genes in
a dominant epistatic relationship. When the genesAandBare both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are ovoid. If the
dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds. That is, every possible genotype other than
aabbresults in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaBbxAaBb) would yield offspring with a
phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid.
As you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that totals
16 is typical of a two-gene interaction. Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendel’s dihybrid cross, which considered
two noninteracting genes—9:3:3:1. Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts.
Note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently into gametes.

cross
Long before scientists visualized chromosomes under a microscope, the father of modern genetics, Gregor
Mendel, began studying heredity in 1843. With improved microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell
biologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell
division and meiosis. With each mitotic division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous
(no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and
migrated to separate cellular poles.
Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to
examine Mendel’s publications and reevaluate his model in terms of chromosome behavior during mitosis
and meiosis. In 1902, Theodor Boveri observed that proper sea urchin embryonic development does not
occur unless chromosomes are present. That same year, Walter Sutton observed chromosome separation
into daughter cells during meiosis (Figure 13.2). Together, these observations led to theChromosomal
Theory of Inheritance, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian
inheritance.
Figure13.2(a) Walter Sutton and (b) Theodor Boveri developed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which states
that chromosomes carry the unit of heredity (genes).
The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel’s laws, which the following
observations supported:
• During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of
other chromosome pairs.
• Chromosome sorting from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random.
• Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half their chromosomal complement.
• Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the
same number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.
• The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same
chromosome number as their parents.
Despite compelling correlations between chromosome behavior during meiosis and Mendel’s abstract laws,

## Section 246.2
• Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage 331
scientists proposed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance long before there was any direct evidence that chromosomes
carried traits. Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes. It
was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster, that Thomas Hunt Morgan
provided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.
Genetic Linkage and Distances
Mendel’s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other. Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence between
a segregating trait and the X chromosome, suggesting that random chromosome segregation was the physical basis of Mendel’s
model. This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel’s predicted outcomes. That each chromosome can carry many
linked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have chromosomes. However, researchers in
Morgan’s laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited together. During
meiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.
Homologous Recombination
In 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata—the point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange
segments—prior to the first meiosis division. He suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically exchange
segments. As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct points. Janssen
suggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments exchanged. We now know that the pairing
and interaction between homologous chromosomes, or synapsis, does more than simply organize the homologs for migration
to separate daughter cells. When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in
homologous recombination, or more simply, “crossing over.”
To better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous
individual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such asAB) and two recessive
paternal alleles for those same genes (such asab). If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes
that are eitherABorabwith a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produceAB,Ab,aB, andabgametes with
equal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment. Because they correspond to new allele
combinations, the genotypes Ab and aB arenonparental typesthat result from homologous recombination during meiosis.
Parental typesare progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. Morgan and his colleagues, however,
found that when they test crossed such heterozygous individuals to a homozygous recessive parent (AaBb×aabb), both parental
and nonparental cases occurred. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were eitherAaBboraabb, but 50 offspring
would also result that were eitherAabboraaBb. These results suggested that linkage occurred most often, but a significant
minority of offspring were the products of recombination.

every meiotic event. The recombination frequency will be the same as if the genes were on separate chromosomes. (d) The actual
recombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent. A crossover
frequency between 0 percent and 50 percent indicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover sometimes occurs.
In a test cross for two characteristics such as the one here, can the recombinant offspring's predicted frequency be 60 percent?
Why or why not?
Genetic Maps
Janssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that scientists did not widely
believe. Scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how chromosomes could break and
rejoin. Yet, the data were clear that linkage did not always occur. Ultimately, it took a young undergraduate student and an “all-
nighter” to mathematically elucidate the linkage and recombination problem.
In 1913, Alfred Sturtevant, a student in Morgan’s laboratory, gathered results from researchers in the laboratory, and took them
home one night to mull them over. By the next morning, he had created the first “chromosome map,” a linear representation of
gene order and relative distance on a chromosome (Figure 13.4).
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure13.4This genetic map ordersDrosophilagenes on the basis of recombination frequency.
Which of the following statements is true?
a. Recombination of the body color and red/cinnabar eye alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of the alleles
for wing length and aristae length.
b. Recombination of the body color and aristae length alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of red/brown eye
alleles and the aristae length alleles.
c. Recombination of the gray/black body color and long/short aristae alleles will not occur.
d. Recombination of the red/brown eye and long/short aristae alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of the
alleles for wing length and body color.
AsFigure 13.4shows, by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, we can infer the relative gene order on
chromosome 2. The values represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which correspond to recombination frequencies (in
percent). Therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5 − 48.5 = 17 cM apart, indicating that the maternal and
paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average.
To construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. He also
assumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood
anywhere along the chromosome's length. Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles that were far
apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which
recombination could occur. Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how a karyogram is created

Inherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during meiosis. We can divide chromosome disorders into
two categories: abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural rearrangements. Because even small
chromosome segments can span many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and often fatal.
Chromosome Identification

clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans. Akaryotypeis the number and appearance of chromosomes, and

includes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual’s karyotype, cytologists
photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, orkaryogram. Another name is an
ideogram (Figure 13.5).
Figure13.5This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have the same centromere
positions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of the XX pair. (credit: Andreas Blozer et al)
In a given species, we can identify chromosomes by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. In a human
karyotype,autosomesor “body chromosomes” (all of the non–sex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order
of size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes. However,
chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. Researchers discovered this after naming Down syndrome as trisomy
21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total). Not wanting to change the name
of this important disease, scientists retained the numbering of chromosome 21 despite describing it having the shortest set of
chromosomes. We may designate the chromosome “arms” projecting from either end of the centromere as short or long,
depending on their relative lengths. We abbreviate the short armp(for “petite”); whereas, we abbreviate the long armq(because
it follows “p” alphabetically). Numbers further subdivide and denote each arm. Using this naming system, we can describe
chromosome locations consistently in the scientific literature.
CAREER CONNECTION
Geneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations
Although we refer to Mendel as the “father of modern genetics,” he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the
geneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which geneticists
can identify traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities from a single cell. To observe an individual’s karyotype, a
geneticist first collects a person’s cells (like white blood cells) from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, he or she
stimulates the isolated cells to begin actively dividing. The geneticist then applies the chemical colchicine to cells to arrest
condensed chromosomes in metaphase. The geneticist then induces swelling in the cells using a hypotonic solution so the
chromosomes spread apart. Finally, the geneticist preserves the sample in a fixative and applies it to a slide.
The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize each chromosome pair's distinct and
reproducible banding patterns. Following staining, the geneticist views the chromosomes using bright-field microscopy. A
common stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giemsa staining results in approximately 400–800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and
condensed proteins) arranged along all 23 chromosome pairs. An experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to
the banding patterns, geneticists further identify chromosomes on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the
classic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous chromosome pairs align in numerical order from longest to shortest,
the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern
(Figure 13.5).
At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes
per cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which one identifies by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome,
which has the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two characterizes. Geneticists can also
identify large DNA deletions or insertions. For instance, geneticists can identify Jacobsen Syndrome—which involves distinctive
facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects—by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint
translocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another

b. Nondisjunction occurring during meiosis II results in 50 percent normal gametes.
c. Nondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50 percent normal gametes.
d. Nondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes.
Aneuploidy
Scientists call an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their specieseuploid. In humans, euploidy
corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome number is
described asaneuploid, a term that includesmonosomy(losing one chromosome) ortrisomy(gaining an extraneous
chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they
lack essential genes. This underscores the importance of “gene dosage” in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop
to birth; however, duplications of some smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several
weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Individuals
with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products, which that chromosome encodes. This extra
dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. The most
common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Short stature and
stunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays characterize
individuals with this inherited disorder. We can correlate the incidence of Down syndrome with maternal age. Older women are
more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype (Figure 13.7).
Figure13.7The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically with maternal age.

Polyploidy
We call an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species)polyploid. For instance,
fertilizing an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely
rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Polyploid animals are sterile
because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable
zygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to
produce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and
more robust than euploids of their species (Figure 13.8).

## Section 250.1
• Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders 339
Scientists have identified and characterized several errors in sex chromosome number. Individuals with three X chromosomes,
triplo-X, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY genotype, corresponding to
one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and
reduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X
chromosomes. In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic
dosage. We see this as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a
single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region,
hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.
Duplications and Deletions
In addition to losing or gaining an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may duplicate or lose itself. Duplications and
deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal
segments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French for “cry of the cat”) is a
syndrome that occurs with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most
5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) (Figure 13.10). Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched cry on which
the disorder’s name is based.
Figure13.10This figure shows an individual with cri-du-chat syndrome at two, four, nine, and 12 years of age. (credit: Paola Cerruti
Mainardi)
Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements
Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and
translocations are the most common. We can identify both during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes
with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment. If the genes on two homologs are not oriented correctly, a
recombination event could result in losing genes from one chromosome and gaining genes on the other. This would produce
aneuploid gametes.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
The Chromosome 18 Inversion
Not all chromosomes' structural rearrangements produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. In rare instances, such a
change can result in new species evolving. In fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to
human evolution. This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees
differ cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in
chimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans.
Scientists believe the pericentric chromosome 18 inversion occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common
ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that
approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on
chromosome 18 of an ancestral human.
A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes—ROCK1and
USP14—that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly
positioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes.
Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees expressUSP14at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and
fibroblasts. Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression
levels in a useful way. Because bothROCK1andUSP14encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular
function. We do not know how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the
divergence of humans from other primates.1
Translocations
Atranslocationoccurs when a chromosome segment dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome.
Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to
regulatory sequences. Notably, specific translocations have occurred with several cancers and with schizophrenia. Reciprocal
translocations result from exchanging chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no
genetic information gain or loss (Figure 13.13).

chromosome. (credit: modification of work by National Human Genome Research/USA)

phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells (leukocytes). He named these chemicals (which would
eventually be known as DNA)nucleinbecause they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.
Figure14.2Friedrich Miescher (1844–1895) discovered nucleic acids.

A half century later, in 1928, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith reported the first demonstration of
bacterialtransformation—a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing its
morphology and physiology. Griffith conducted his experiments withStreptococcus pneumoniae,a
bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains of this bacterium called rough (R) and
smooth (S). (The two cell types were called “rough” and “smooth” after the appearance of their colonies grown
on a nutrient agar plate.)
The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease). The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing), and
has a capsule outside its cell wall. The capsule allows the cell to escape the immune responses of the host
mouse.
When Griffith injected the living S strain into mice, they died from pneumonia. In contrast, when Griffith
injected the live R strain into mice, they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the
heat-killed S strain, they also survived. This experiment showed that the capsule alone was not the cause of
death. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into
mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S
strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died.
Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and
transformed it into the pathogenic S strain. He called this thetransforming principle(Figure 14.3). These
experiments are now known as Griffith's transformation experiments.

Figure14.3Two strains ofS. pneumoniaewere used in Griffith’s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic, whereas the
S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The
S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain,
transforming the R strain into the S strain in the process. (credit "living mouse": modification of work by NIH; credit "dead mouse":
modification of work by Sarah Marriage)
Scientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle
further. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) as these were
possible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used
each mixture separately to transform the R strain. They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no
longer able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. This led them to
conclude that DNA was the transforming principle.

Forensic Scientist
Forensic Scientists used DNA analysis evidence for the first time to solve an immigration case. The story started with a teenage
boy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him,
thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the
immigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the
authorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester
University in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known asDNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities
approached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, as well as an unrelated
mother, and compared the samples with the boy’s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three
children was compared with the boy’s DNA. He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings. He
concluded that the boy was indeed the mother’s son.
Forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the
DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis
includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to
present their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists
experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college
and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in
chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.
Although the experiments of Avery, McCarty and McLeod had demonstrated that DNA was the informational component
transferred during transformation, DNA was still considered to be too simple a molecule to carry biological information.
Proteins, with their 20 different amino acids, were regarded as more likely candidates. The decisive experiment, conducted by
Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952, provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was indeed the genetic material and not
proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying abacteriophage—a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple

Chargaff's findings proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix
model! You can see after reading the past few pages how science builds upon previous discoveries, sometimes in a slow and
laborious process.

DNA Structure and Sequencing
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the structure of DNA
• Explain the Sanger method of DNA sequencing
• Discuss the similarities and differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA
The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous (nitrogen-bearing)
base, a 5-carbon sugar (pentose), and a phosphate group (Figure 14.5). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous
base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and
thymine (T).
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure14.5The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in
size; they have a single six-membered ring structure.
The images above illustrate the five bases of DNA and RNA. Examine the images and explain why these are called “nitrogenous
bases.” How are the purines different from the pyrimidines? How is one purine or pyrimidine different from another, e.g.,
adenine from guanine? How is a nucleoside different from a nucleotide?
The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in
size; they have a single six-membered ring structure.
The sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5'
(1' is read as “one prime”). The phosphate, which makes DNA and RNA acidic, is connected to the 5' carbon of the sugar by the
formation of an ester linkage between phosphoric acid and the 5'-OH group (an ester is an acid + an alcohol). In DNA
nucleotides, the 3' carbon of the sugar deoxyribose is attached to a hydroxyl (OH) group. In RNA nucleotides, the 2' carbon of the
sugar ribose also contains a hydroxyl group. The base is attached to the 1'carbon of the sugar.
The nucleotides combine with each other to produce phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate residue attached to the 5' carbon of
the sugar of one nucleotide forms a second ester linkage with the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next
nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond. In a polynucleotide, one end of the chain has a free 5' phosphate, and
the other end has a free 3'-OH. These are called the 5' and 3' ends of the chain.
In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of
Cambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field. Pauling

automated machines, the process is cheaper, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. Fred Sanger developed the
sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today (Figure 14.8).
LINK TO LEARNING
Visitthis site(http://openstax.org/l/DNA_sequencing)to watch a video explaining the DNA sequence-reading technique that
resulted from Sanger’s work.
The sequencing method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. The method is based on the use of chain
terminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPSs differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' OH group
on the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing DNA strand, the chain cannot be extended any further because the
free 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of deoxynucleotides to
dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.
Figure14.8In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to generate DNA fragments
that terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis (not defined) on the basis of size, and from the order of
fragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram (not defined) that is
generated by a laser scanner.
The DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured (separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures). The DNA is
divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleoside triphosphates (A, T, G, and C) are added. In
addition, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddCTP, ddATP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) are added to
each tube respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the
four dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide
is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a
difference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner that detects the fluorescent
marker of each fragment. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980.

Gel electrophoresisis a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical
calledagarose(a polysaccharide polymer extracted from seaweed that is high in galactose residues). Agarose powder is added to
a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on
the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the
positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest
fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest
to the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it (Figure 14.9).

Figure14.10A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called
the nucleoid.
In eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic cells, both
processes occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages might there be to
having them occur together?
The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes,E.coli,is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut
and stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling.
Supercoiling suggests that DNA is either “under-wound” (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or “over-wound”
(more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling;
other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.
Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their
DNA inside the nucleus (Figure 14.11). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known ashistonesto form
structures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an
octamer composed of two molecules of each of four different histones. The DNA (remember, it is negatively charged because of
the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a
linker DNA. This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure. With the help of a fifth histone, a string of nucleosomes is
further compacted into a 30-nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. Metaphase chromosomes are even further
condensed by association with scaffolding proteins. At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact,
approximately 700 nm in width.
In interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged
region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains
genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains
genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.

Basics of DNA Replication
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how the structure of DNA reveals the replication process
• Describe the Meselson and Stahl experiments
The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. In their
1953 paper, Watson and Crick penned an incredible understatement: "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we
have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." With specific base pairs, the
sequence of one DNA strand can be predicted from its complement. The double-helix model suggests that the two strands of the
double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is
copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (Figure 14.12):conservative,
semi-conservative, and dispersive.

Figure14.12The three suggested models of DNA replication. Gray indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized
DNA.
In conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-
conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after
replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. In the dispersive model,
both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.
Meselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grewE. colifor several generations in a
medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N), which gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the
DNA (Figure 14.13).
Figure14.13Meselson and Stahl experimented withE. coligrown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in14N. DNA grown in15N (red band) is
heavier than DNA grown in14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride solution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA
grown in15N is switched to media containing14N, after one round of cell division the DNA sediments halfway between the15N and14N
levels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent14N. In subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains14N only. These

DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes
• Discuss the role of different enzymes and proteins in supporting this process
DNA replication has been well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and because of the large
variety of mutants that are available.E. colihas 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets
replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single site along the chromosome and proceeding around the circle in
both directions. This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. Thus, the process is quite rapid and
occurs without many mistakes.
DNA replication employs a large number of structural proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the
process. One of the key players is the enzymeDNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one-by-one to
the growing DNA chain that is complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy
is obtained from the nucleoside triphosphates ATP, GTP, TTP and CTP. Like ATP, the otherNTPs(nucleoside triphosphates) are
high-energy molecules that can serve both as the source of DNA nucleotides and the source of energy to drive the
polymerization. When the bond between the phosphates is “broken,” the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester
bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known:
DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I is
an important accessory enzyme in DNA replication, and along with DNA pol II, is primarily required for repair.
How does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called
origins of replicationwhere replication begins. InE. coli,which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome (as do
most prokaryotes), this origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of
replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme calledhelicaseunwinds the DNA by breaking the
hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped
structures calledreplication forksare formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get
extended bi-directionally as replication proceeds.Single-strand binding proteinscoat the single strands of DNA near the
replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix.
DNA polymerase has two important restrictions: it is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can
be only extended in this direction). It also requires a free 3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a
phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide. This essentially means that it cannot
add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available. Then how does it add the first nucleotide? The problem is solved with the

help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end. Another enzyme, RNAprimase, synthesizes an RNA segment that is about
five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the template DNA. Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is
appropriately called theprimer. DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one-by-one that are
complementary to the template strand (Figure 14.14).
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure14.14A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication. The DNA tends to become
more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase breaks and reforms DNA’s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication
fork, thereby relieving the pressure that results from this “supercoiling.” Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to
prevent the helix from re-forming. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter
DNA strand. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches
called Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments,
joining the fragments into a single DNA molecule. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
Question: You isolate a cell strain in which the joining of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has
occurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?
The replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA
double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and
then resealing it. Because DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, and because the DNA double helix is
antiparallel, there is a slight problem at the replication fork.The two template DNA strands have opposing orientations:one
strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. Only one new DNA strand, the one that is
complementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, can be synthesized continuously towards the replication fork. This
continuously synthesized strand is known as theleading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA,
is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known asOkazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start
the synthesis. New primer segments are laid down in the direction of the replication fork, but each pointing away from it.
(Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is
known as thelagging strand.)
The leading strand can be extended from a single primer, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short
Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein
called thesliding clampholds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-
shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by
DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, which uses DNA behind the RNA as its own primer and
fills in the gaps left by removal of the RNA nucleotides by the addition of DNA nucleotides. The nicks that remain between the
newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA
ligase, which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkages between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate
end of the other fragment.
Once the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division.

Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. Eukaryotes also have a number of
different linear chromosomes. The human genome has 3 billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base
pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on each eukaryotic
chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication across the genome. The rate of replication is approximately

100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication. In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known
as autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in
E. coli.
The number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than in prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have
major roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as polα, polβ, polγ, polδ, and polε.
The essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available
as a template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. Histones
must be removed and then replaced during the replication process, which helps to account for the lower replication rate in
eukaryotes. The chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the
DNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of
replication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Helicase and other proteins are then recruited to
start the replication process (Table 14.2).

Table14.2
A helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication origin
as the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication
fork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer,
DNA pol can start synthesis. Three major DNA polymerases are then involved: α, δ and ε. DNA pol α adds a short (20 to 30
nucleotides) DNA fragment to the RNA primer on both strands, and then hands off to a second polymerase. While the leading
strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme polε, the lagging strand is synthesized by polδ. A sliding clamp protein
known as PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA. As pol δ runs
into the primer RNA on the lagging strand, it displaces it from the DNA template. The displaced primer RNA is then removed by
RNase H (AKA flap endonuclease) and replaced with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined
after the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the
phosphodiester bond.
Telomere replication
Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add
nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached.
On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the
replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no way to replace the primer on the 5’ end of the lagging
strand. The DNA at the ends of the chromosome thus remains unpaired, and over time these ends, calledtelomeres,may get
progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.

Telomerase and Aging
Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase.
This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine, preventative
health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look
younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.
In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in
regenerative medicine.2Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell
depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension
of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and
intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.
Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate
uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that
cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the
telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be
inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.

## Section 263.2
DNA Repair
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the different types of mutations in DNA
• Explain DNA repair mechanisms
DNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong
base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the
mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves
mutated or defective.
Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase itself.
(Figure 14.17). Inproofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be
made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the
right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester
bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the 3' exonuclease action of DNA pol. Once the incorrect
nucleotide has been removed, it can be replaced by the correct one.
Figure14.17Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.
Some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is
known asmismatch repair(Figure 14.18). Specific repair enzymes recognize the mispaired nucleotide and excise part of the
strand that contains it; the excised region is then resynthesized. If the mismatch remains uncorrected, it may lead to more
permanent damage when the mismatched DNA is replicated. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two
bases is the incorrect one? InE. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA

pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the
damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals,
the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix,
and this may cause problems during DNA replication. People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting
skin cancer than those who don't have the condition.
Figure14.20Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV light is not repaired. Exposure to
sunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)
Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA.Mutations, variations in the nucleotide
sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous.
Induced mutationsare those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent.
Spontaneous mutationsoccur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking
place within the body.
Mutations may have a wide range of effects. Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most
common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These substitutions can be of two
types, either transitions or transversions.Transition substitutionrefers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of

Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Given the different numbers of “letters” in
the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that single amino acids must be represented by combinations of
nucleotides. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-

Question: Would a kiwi and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure 15.6) also have approximately the same
amount of DNA?
Background: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies
of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is
hexaploid (6n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might
correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell nuclei. What other factors might contribute to the total amount of DNA in
a single fruit? Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate
and precipitate DNA.
Hypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries
and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?

Prokaryotic Transcription
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the different steps in prokaryotic transcription
• Discuss the role of promoters in prokaryotic transcription
• Describe how and when transcription is terminated
The prokaryotes, which include Bacteria and Archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-
bound nuclei and other organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not
organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid region.
In addition, prokaryotes often have abundantplasmids, which are shorter, circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or
a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits
such as those involved with antibiotic resistance.
Transcription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA
synthesis. The region of unwinding is called atranscription bubble.Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand
for each gene, which is called thetemplate strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost
identical to the other DNA strand, called thenontemplate strand, or the coding strand. The only nucleotide difference is that in
mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides (Figure 15.7). In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two
hydrogen bonds, just as in A–T pairing in a DNA double helix.

in the coding sequence. However, new RNA nucleotides base pair with the nucleotides of the template strand. RNA is synthesized in its
5'-3' direction, using the enzyme RNA polymerase. As the template is read, the DNA unwinds ahead of the polymerase and then rewinds
behind it.
The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed
is called the +1 site, or theinitiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are denoted with a “-” and are designated
upstream nucleotides. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “+” numbering and are called
downstream nucleotides.
Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA
degradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple
transcription and translation events that occur concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic genomes are very compact,
and prokaryotic transcripts often cover more than one gene or cistron (a coding sequence for a single protein). Polycistronic
mRNAs are then translated to produce more than one kind of protein.
Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process inEscherichia coli, a well-studied eubacterial
species. Although some differences exist between transcription inE. coliand transcription in archaea, an understanding ofE.
colitranscription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.
Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase
Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. InE. coli, the polymerase is composed of five
polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denotedα,α,β, andβ', comprise the polymerasecore
enzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each
subunit has a unique role; the twoα-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; theβ-subunit binds to the
ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent mRNA molecule; and theβ' subunit binds the DNA template
strand. The fifth subunit,σ, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the
polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Withoutσ, the core enzyme would transcribe from
random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five
subunits is called theholoenzyme.
Prokaryotic Promoters
Apromoteris a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase, binds and initiates
transcription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very
important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently.
Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are evolutionarily conserved in many species. At the -10
and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are twopromoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across
all promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure 15.8). The -10 sequence, called the -10 region, has the consensus
sequence TATAAT. The -35 sequence has the consensus sequence TTGACA. These consensus sequences are recognized and
bound byσ. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates
unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the
production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.
Figure15.8Theσsubunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the
transcription start site. Theσsubunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.

Eukaryotic Transcription
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the steps in eukaryotic transcription
• Discuss the role of RNA polymerases in transcription
• Compare and contrast the three RNA polymerases
• Explain the significance of transcription factors
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most
important difference between prokaryote and eukaryote transcription is due to the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus and
organelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must
protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each
transcribe a different subset of genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are usuallymonogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.
Initiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes
Unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called
transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then to help recruit the appropriate polymerase.
The Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases
The features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex than those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single
polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. Each
eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.
RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed,
processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table 15.1). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a
cellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of
translation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs from the tandemly duplicated set of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal
genes. (Note that the “S” designation applies to “Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a
particle sediments during centrifugation.)
Locations, Products, and Sensitivities of the Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases
RNA Polymerase Cellular Compartment Product of Transcription α-Amanitin Sensitivity
I Nucleolus All rRNAs except 5S rRNA Insensitive
II Nucleus All protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs Extremely sensitive
III Nucleus 5S rRNA, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs Moderately sensitive
Table15.1
RNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs
undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module’s discussion of transcription
and translation in eukaryotes will use the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be
translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.
RNA polymerase IIIis also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S
pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), andsmall nuclearpre-RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve
as the “adaptor molecules” between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs have a variety
of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.
A scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in
the presence of α-amanitin, an oligopeptide toxin produced by the fly agaric toadstool mushroom and other species ofAmanita.
Interestingly, the α-amanitin affects the three polymerases very differently (Table 15.1). RNA polymerase I is completely

bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “active” genes that
are constantly being expressed by the cell.
Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently
recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation. The complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the
polymerases and promoters. An army of other transcription factors, which bind to upstream enhancers and silencers, also help
to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of
transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed.
Promoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III
The processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of
transcription factors, but the general theme is the same.
The conserved promoter elements for genes transcribed by polymerases I and III differ from those transcribed by RNA
polymerase II. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These
sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from
-180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III
have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.
Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the
DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it
ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
The Evolution of Promoters
The evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or
may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can
transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as
well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a
structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial
to the cell for that gene’s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.
Scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to
infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far
upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to
human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found
that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.
It is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other complex organisms. However,
the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution
of the genes themselves.1
Eukaryotic Elongation and Termination
Following the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and
elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction.
As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so in this section we will focus on
how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.
Although the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is
considerably more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins
called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. TheseDNA–histone
complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the different steps in RNA processing
• Understand the significance of exons, introns, and splicing for mRNAs
• Explain how tRNAs and rRNAs are processed
After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic
(and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein-synthesis
machinery.
mRNA Processing
The eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. Eukaryotic protein-coding
sequences are not continuous, as they are in prokaryotes. The coding sequences (exons) are interrupted by noncoding introns,
which must be removed to make a translatable mRNA. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation also create
a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical
E. colimRNA lasts no more than five seconds.
Pre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and
exported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and
signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of the introns (Figure 15.11). In rare cases, the mRNA
transcript can be “edited” after it is transcribed.

genusGlossina(commonly called tsetse flies). Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called
mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are
believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial
DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to the central dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct
information to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell
performs an additional RNA processing step calledRNA editingto remedy this.
Figure15.12Trypanosoma bruceiis the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by
the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)
Other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by
complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript. However, theguide RNAhas more A
nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides with which to bind. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of
guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide
RNAs are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the
catalysts in RNA editing.
RNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited.
RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. What could be the evolutionary
reason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient
prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits
made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a
holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.
5' Capping
While the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a7-methylguanosine capis added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a
phosphate linkage. This functional group protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors involved in protein
synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.
3' Poly-A Tail
Once elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-
rich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds a string of
approximately 200 A residues, called thepoly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and is
also the binding site for a protein necessary for exporting the processed mRNA to the cytoplasm.
Pre-mRNA Splicing
Eukaryotic genes are composed ofexons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are
expressed), andintervening sequences calledintrons(int-ron denotes theirintervening role), which may be involved in gene
regulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional

• Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis 383
Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs
The tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these RNAs are not themselves
translated. Pre-rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus. Pre-tRNAs are transcribed
and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein
synthesis.
Most of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans
multiple rRNAs or tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural RNA. Some of the
bases of pre-rRNAs aremethylated; that is, a –CH methyl functional group is added for stability. Pre-tRNA molecules also

undergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined to become tRNAs or
rRNAs.
Mature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural,
whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through local regions of
base pairing stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The tRNA folds to position the amino acid binding site at one end
and theanticodonat the other end (Figure 15.14). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an
mRNA codon through complementary base pairing.

anticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA. The amino acid phenylalanine is attached to the other end of the tRNA.

The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more
mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function
of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product.
Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 to more

“translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.
Of the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C—three specify the termination of protein synthesis
and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of
translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one or more of the mRNA codons for its amino acid. For instance, if the
sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a leucine tRNA expressing the
complementary sequence, GAU. The ability of some tRNAs to match more than one codon is what gives the genetic code its
blocky structure.
As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package.
Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see
below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.
Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases
The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The
corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process
of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by one of a group of enzymes calledaminoacyl tRNA
synthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of
aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond
between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The
activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released. The term "charging" is appropriate, since the high-
energy bond that attaches an amino acid to its tRNA is later used to drive the formation of the peptide bond. Each tRNA is
named for its amino acid.
The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis
As with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases:initiation, elongation, and termination. The
process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we’ll explore how translation occurs inE. coli, a
representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.
Initiation of Translation
Protein synthesis begins with the formation of aninitiation complex. InE. coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome,
the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a specialinitiator tRNA, called tRNAMetf.
InE. colimRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with
the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on
the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during
translation—both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome’s translocation. Binding of the mRNA to the 30S ribosome
also requires IF-III.
The initiator tRNA then interacts with thestart codonAUG (or rarely, GUG). This tRNA carries the amino acid methionine,
which is formylated after its attachment to the tRNA. The formylation creates a "faux" peptide bond between the formyl carboxyl
group and the amino group of the methionine. Binding of the fMet-tRNAMetfis mediated by the initiation factor IF-2. The fMet
begins every polypeptide chain synthesized byE. coli, but it is usually removed after translation is complete. When an in-frame
AUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet. After
the formation of the initiation complex, the 30S ribosomal subunit is joined by the 50S subunit to form the translation complex.
In eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic IFs, and
nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The methionine on the charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNA, is not formylated.
i
However, Met-tRNA is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.
i
Instead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap
at the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap.
Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many
eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According toKozak’s rules, the nucleotides
around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must
appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but
cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.

VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure15.16Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a start codon on mRNA bound to a small ribosomal subunit.
The large ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome,
successive tRNAs move through the ribosome and the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates
translation and the components dissociate.
Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and
chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein
synthesis?
Tetracycline would directly affect:
a. tRNA binding to the ribosome
b. ribosome assembly
c. growth of the protein chain
Chloramphenicol would directly affect:
a. tRNA binding to the ribosome
b. ribosome assembly
c. growth of the protein chain
Termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered. Upon aligning with the A site,
these nonsense codons are recognized byprotein release factorsthat resemble tRNAs. The releasing factors in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction
forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal
subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation

Regulation of Gene Expression
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss why every cell does not express all of its genes all of the time
• Describe how prokaryotic gene regulation occurs at the transcriptional level
• Discuss how eukaryotic gene regulation occurs at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-
transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels
For a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time and place. All cells
control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning
on a gene to produce RNA and protein is calledgene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism
or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to
occur, there must be internal chemical mechanisms that control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and
protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no
longer needed.
The regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of
energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes
only when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because
DNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would
have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.
The control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell
and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.
Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression
To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional
protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different
manners.
Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats
freely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur
almost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the
primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic
cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more
protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression
is mostly at the transcriptional level.
Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells,
the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized
RNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into
protein. The processes of transcription and translation arephysically separatedby the nuclear membrane;
transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the
cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.2). Regulation
may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors
(epigeneticlevel), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptionallevel), when the RNA is processed and
exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptionallevel), when the RNA is translated into
protein (translationallevel), or after the protein has been made (post-translationallevel).

translational modifications of proteins.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Evolution of Gene Regulation
Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription. As eukaryotic cells evolved, the
complexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came
compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the DNA was
formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became
possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein
translation present outside the nucleus.
Most gene regulation is done to conserve cell resources. However, other regulatory processes may be defensive. Cellular

Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the steps involved in prokaryotic gene regulation
• Explain the roles of activators, inducers, and repressors in gene regulation
The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome, supercoiled within the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm.
Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in
blocks calledoperons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the
lactose (orlac) operon, and transcribed into a single mRNA.
In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors,
activators, and inducers. Repressors and activators are proteins produced in the cell. Both repressors and activators regulate
gene expression by binding to specific DNA sitesadjacentto the genes they control.In general, activators bind to the promoter
site, while repressors bind to operator regions.Repressorsprevent transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus,
whereasactivatorsincrease the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Inducers are small molecules that
may be produced by the cell or that are in the cell’s environment. Inducers either activate or repress transcription depending on
the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.
ThetrpOperon: A Repressible Operon
Bacteria such asEscherichia colineed amino acids to survive, and are able to synthesize many of them.Tryptophanis one such
amino acid thatE. colican either ingest from the environment or synthesize using enzymes that are encoded by five genes.
These five genes are next to each other in what is called thetryptophan (trp) operon(Figure 16.3). The genes are transcribed into
a single mRNA, which is then translated to produce all five enzymes. If tryptophan is present in the environment, thenE. coli
does not need to synthesize it and thetrpoperon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch
controlling the operon is turned on, the mRNA is transcribed, the enzyme proteins are translated, and tryptophan is
synthesized.
Figure16.3The tryptophan operon. The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan inE. coliare located next to each other in the
trpoperon. When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence. This physically
blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the
operator and the genes are transcribed.
Thetrpoperon includes three important regions: the coding region, thetrpoperator and thetrppromoter. The coding region

includes the genes for the five tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes. Just before the coding region is thetranscriptional start site.
The promoter sequence, to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription, is before or “upstream” of the transcriptional
start site. Between the promoter and the transcriptional start site is the operator region.
Thetrpoperatorcontains the DNA code to which thetrprepressor protein can bind. However, the repressor alone cannot bind
to the operator. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to thetrprepressor, which changes the
shape of the repressor protein to a form that can bind to thetrpoperator. Binding of the tryptophan–repressor complex at the
operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and transcribing the downstream genes.
When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator, the polymerase can transcribe
the enzyme genes, and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes
turned off, thetrpoperon is said to benegatively regulatedand the proteins that bind to the operator to silencetrpexpression

Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): A Transcriptional Activator
Just as thetrpoperon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the promoter sequences
that act aspositive regulatorsto turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce,E. colibacteria can turn
to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate sugars must be transcribed. When glucose levels
drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose
and energy metabolism inE. coli. Accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulatorcatabolite activator protein (CAP), a
protein that binds to the promoters of operons which control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the
complex then binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.4). In these
operons, a CAP-binding site is located upstream of the RNA-polymerase-binding site in the promoter. CAP binding stabilizes
the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and increases transcription of the associated protein-coding genes.
Figure16.4Transcriptional activation by the CAP protein. When glucose levels fall,E. colimay use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe
new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator
that binds to a promoter region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.
ThelacOperon: An Inducible Operon
The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs throughinducible operons, which have proteins that bind to activate
or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. Thelacoperon is a typical inducible
operon. As mentioned previously,E. coliis able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. One

Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how chromatin remodeling controls transcriptional access
• Describe how access to DNA is controlled by histone modification
• Describe how DNA methylation is related to epigenetic gene changes
Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and
translation are physically separated. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different
levels. Epigenetic changes are inheritable changes in gene expression that do not result from changes in the DNA sequence.
Eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA. Transcriptional access to the DNA can be controlled in two
general ways: chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. Chromatin remodeling changes the way that DNA is associated
with chromosomal histones. DNA methylation is associated with developmental changes and gene silencing.
Epigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the Chromosome
The human genome encodes over 20,000 genes, with hundreds to thousands of genes on each of the 23 human chromosomes.
The DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. It is also
organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.
The first level of organization, orpacking, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins. Histones package and order
DNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions (Figure
16.6a). Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads
on a string (Figure 16.6b).

--- Page 422 ---
402

# Chapter 291

## Section 291.1
• Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation 403
How closely the histone proteins associate with the DNA is regulated by signals found on both the histone proteins and on the
DNA. These signals are functional groups added to histone proteins or to DNA and determine whether a chromosomal region
should be open or closed (Figure 16.8depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but
may be added or removed as needed. Some chemical groups (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) are attached to specific amino
acids in histone "tails" at the N-terminus of the protein. These groups do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how
tightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule and unmodified histones are
positively charged; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. By
adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive, and the binding of DNA to the histones is
relaxed. Altering the location of nucleosomes and the tightness of histone binding opens some regions of chromatin to
transcription and closes others.
The DNA molecule itself can also be modified by methylation. DNA methylation occurs within very specific regions called CpG
islands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter
regions of genes. The cytosine member of the CG pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). Methylated genes are usually
silenced, although methylation may have other regulatory effects. In some cases, genes that are silenced during the
development of the gametes of one parent are transmitted in their silenced condition to the offspring. Such genes are said to be
imprinted. Parental diet or other environmental conditions may also affect the methylation patterns of genes, which in turn
modifies gene expression. Changes in chromatin organization interact with DNA methylation. DNA methyltransferases appear
to be attracted to chromatin regions with specific histone modifications. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions
with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.
Figure16.8Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene
expression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)
Epigenetic changes are not permanent, although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division and may even cross
generational lines. Chromatin remodeling alters the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. If a gene is to be
transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA in the chromosomal region encoding that gene are modified in a way that opens the
promoter region to allow RNA polymerase and other proteins, calledtranscription factors, to bind and initiate transcription. If
a gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed
chromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to
the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.8).

Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the role of transcription factors in gene regulation
• Explain how enhancers and repressors regulate gene expression
Like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the action of an RNA polymerase to bind to a DNA
sequence upstream of a gene in order to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA
polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. RNA polymerase by itself
cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. There are two types of transcription factors that regulate eukaryotic
transcription:General (or basal) transcription factorsbind to the core promoter region to assist with the binding of RNA
polymerase.Specific transcription factorsbind to various regions outside of the core promoter region and interact with the
proteins at the core promoter to enhance or repress the activity of the polymerase.

The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery
Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding
sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the
promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of
the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression
can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of thepromoteris to bind transcription factors that control the
initiation of transcription.
Within the core promoter region, 25 to 35 bases upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. The TATA box
has the consensus sequence of 5’-TATAAA-3’. The TATA box is the binding site for a protein complex called TFIID, which contains
a TATA-binding protein. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Some
of these transcription factors help to bind the RNA polymerase to the promoter, and others help to activate the transcription
initiation complex.
In addition to the TATA box, other binding sites are found in some promoters. Some biologists prefer to restrict the range of the
eukaryotic promoter to the core promoter, or polymerase binding site, and refer to these additional sites as promoter-proximal
elements, because they are usually found within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Examples of
these elements are the CAAT box, with the consensus sequence 5’-CCAAT-3’ and the GC box, with the consensus sequence 5’-
GGGCGG-3’. Specific transcription factors can bind to these promoter-proximal elements to regulate gene transcription. A
given gene may have its own combination of these specific transcription-factor binding sites. There are hundreds of
transcription factors in a cell, each of which binds specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors
bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as acis-acting element, because it is on the same
chromosome just next to the gene. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their
binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.
Enhancers and Transcription
In some eukaryotic genes, there are additional regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called
enhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region
of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.
Enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for specific transcription factors. When a protein transcription factor binds to

its enhancer sequence, the shape of the protein changes, allowing it to interact with proteins at the promoter site. However,
since the enhancer region may be distant from the promoter, the DNA must bend to allow the proteins at the two sites to come
into contact. DNA bending proteins help to bend the DNA and bring the enhancer and promoter regions together (Figure 16.9).
This shape change allows for the interaction of the specific activator proteins bound to the enhancers with the general
transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase.
Figure16.9Interaction between proteins at the promoter and enhancer sites. An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription.
Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact
with mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements,
enabling differential gene expression.
Turning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors
Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to
promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external
stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Understand RNA splicing and explain its role in regulating gene expression
• Describe the importance of RNA stability in gene regulation
RNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing that takes place
after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is calledpost-transcriptional
modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be
regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be
synthesized.
RNA Splicing, the First Stage of Post-transcriptional Control
In eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The regions
of RNA that code for protein are calledexons. (Figure 16.10). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its
departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing. Splicing is done by

many genetic diseases is abnormal splicing rather than mutations in a coding sequence. However, alternative splicing could
possibly create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new
variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by
providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.
Question: In the corn snakePantherophis guttatus, there are several different color variants, including amelanistic snakes
whose skin patterns display only red and yellow pigments. The cause of amelanism in these snakes was recently identified as the
insertion of a transposable element into an intron in the OCA2 (oculocutaneous albinism) gene. How might the insertion of
extra genetic material into an intron lead to a nonfunctional protein?

Control of RNA Stability
Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective "caps" that prevent the ends of the strand from degrading during
its journey. 5' and 3' exonucleases can degrade unprotected RNAs. The5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is
usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The GTP is placed "backward" on the 5' end of the
mRNA, so that the 5' carbons of the GTP and the terminal nucleotide are linked through three phosphates. Thepoly-A tail, which
is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a long chain of adenine nucleotides. These changes protect the two ends of the
RNA from exonuclease attack.
Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA
molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If
the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time available for translation of the
mRNA to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the mRNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more
protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer
periods of time in the cytoplasm.
Binding of proteins to the RNA can also influence its stability. Proteins calledRNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the
regions of the mRNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not
translated into protein are called theuntranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the
nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the
protein-coding region is called the5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the3' UTR(Figure 16.12). The
binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that
binds.
Figure16.12RNA-binding proteins. The protein-coding region of this processed mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).
The presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.
RNA Stability and microRNAs
In addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to
the RNA molecule. ThesemicroRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21 to 24 nucleotides in length. The
miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein
calledDicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however,
miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called theRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RNA
component of the RISC base-pairs with complementary sequences on an mRNA and either impede translation of the message

Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene
Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Understand the process of translation and discuss its key factors
• Describe how the initiation complex controls translation
• Explain the different ways in which the post-translational control of gene expression takes place
After RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on
the RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As
the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.
The Initiation Complex and Translation Rate
Like transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. In translation, the complex that
assembles to start the process is referred to as the translationinitiation complex. In eukaryotes, translation is initiated by
binding the initiating met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. This tRNA is brought to the 40S ribosome by a protein initiation factor,
eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-2 protein binds to the high-energy moleculeguanosine triphosphate (GTP). The
tRNA-eIF2-GTP complex then binds to the 40S ribosome. A second complex forms on the mRNA. Several different initiation
factors recognize the 5' cap of the mRNA and proteins bound to the poly-A tail of the same mRNA, forming the mRNA into a
loop. The cap-binding protein eIF4F brings the mRNA complex together with the 40S ribosome complex. The ribosome then
scans along the mRNA until it finds a start codon AUG. When the anticodon of the initiator tRNA and the start codon are
aligned, the GTP is hydrolyzed, the initiation factors are released, and the large60S ribosomal subunitbinds to form the
translation complex. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a
conformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is
impeded (Figure 16.13). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, the initiation complex can form normally and translation can
proceed.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure16.13Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.
An increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?
Chemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity
Proteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The
addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes
these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, or attached

to the plasma membrane.
Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light
exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in
changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in
response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein
(depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering
transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore
complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase
or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).
The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the
protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to theproteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be
degraded (Figure 16.14). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.
Figure16.14Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.

## Section 294.3
Cancer and Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how changes to gene expression can cause cancer
• Explain how changes to gene expression at different levels can disrupt the cell cycle
• Discuss how understanding regulation of gene expression can lead to better drug design
Cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells
don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the
cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that
controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.
For cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has
properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin
B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can
progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-
translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer.
Cancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression
Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene
activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed in that
cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation
(epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).
Changes in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be
detected in cancer. While these changes don’t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected
when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes inhistone acetylation(epigenetic
modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability,
increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells. Scientists are

## Section 295.1
• Cancer and Gene Regulation 411
Cancer and Post-transcriptional Control
Changes in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have
shown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to
degrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could
dramatically decrease the RNA population, leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a
change in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is
quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that alterations in
miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are
specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new
drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.
Cancer and Translational/Post-translational Control
There are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications are
found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative splice
variants of a protein. An example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically different
outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. The c-Flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell-death pathway, comes in two
forms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS). Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell-death mechanisms in
normal cells. However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death.
Clearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer.
New Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies
Scientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new
ways to treat and prevent disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns
within individual tumors. This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of
personalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to
specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited
the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such
example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the
EGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression
changes can cause cancer.

Clinical Trial Coordinator
A clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes coordinating patient
schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term
follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors
to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. A clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing
degree, or other certification. People who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical
trial coordinator. These jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctor’s offices also conduct clinical trials and
may hire a coordinator.

Scientists perform RNA analysis to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are
commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves using various buffers and
enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.
Gel Electrophoresis
Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, an electric field can
mobilize them.Gel electrophoresisis a technique that scientists use to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this
charge. One can separate the nucleic acids as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids load into a slot near the
semisolid, porous gel matrix's negative electrode, and pulled toward the positive electrode at the gel's opposite end. Smaller
molecules move through the gel's pores faster than larger molecules. This difference in the migration rate separates the
fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that researchers can run alongside the molecules to
provide a size comparison. We can observe nucleic acids in a gel matrix using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct
nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the gel's top (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their
size (Figure 17.4). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear; whereas, uncut genomic DNA
is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the gel's top.

DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process calledreverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The first
step is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA. This process is
called reverse transcription. This requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. After the cDNA is made,
regular PCR can be used to amplify it.

Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineeringis the alteration of an organism’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s
DNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular
cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is agenetically
modified organism(GMO). If the foreign DNA comes from a different species, the host organism istransgenic. Scientists have
genetically modified bacteria, plants, and animals since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial
purposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed
foods.
Gene Targeting
Although classical methods of studying gene function began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that
phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: "What does this gene or DNA
element do?" This technique, reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology. This method would be
similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing's
function is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that
the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene
function. We collectively call the methods they use to disable gene function gene targeting.Gene targetingis the use of
recombinant DNA vectors to alter a particular gene's expression, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating a
certain gene's expression by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the organism's genome.

Researchers cloned the HGH gene from a cDNA library and inserted it intoE. colicells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.
Transgenic Animals
Although several recombinant proteins in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic
animal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats,
chickens, and mice. We call animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA transgenic animals. Several human
proteins are expressed in transgenic sheep and goat milk, and some are expressed in chicken eggs. Scientists have used mice
extensively for expressing and studying recombinant gene and mutation effects.
Transgenic Plants
Manipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide
and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 17.10). Plants are the most important source of
food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-
day biotechnology practices were established.
Figure17.10Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through plant
biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)
We call plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species transgenic plants. Because they are not natural,
government agencies closely monitor transgenic plants and other GMOs to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and
do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive

scientists genetically engineered.
Transformation of Plants UsingAgrobacterium tumefaciens
Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as
cancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacteriumAgrobacterium
tumefaciensoccur by DNA transfer from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they stunt the
plants and they become more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions.A. tumefaciensaffects many plants such as
walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets. Artificially introducing DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells
because of the thick plant cell wall.

Mapping Genomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define genomics
• Describe genetic and physical maps
• Describe genomic mapping methods
Genomicsis the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and
their interactions within a species and with other species.Genome mappingis the process of finding the locations of genes on
each chromosome. The maps that genome mapping create are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. Agenetic
mapis an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to an
interstate highway map) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). Agenetic markeris a gene or sequence on a
chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis.
Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller chromosome regions (similar to a detailed road map). Aphysical mapis a
representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and
physical maps are required to build a genome’s complete picture. Having a complete genome map of the genome makes it easier
for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-
causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. We can use genome mapping in a variety of other
applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome
mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.
Genetic Maps
The study of genetic maps begins withlinkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes
to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. Scientists used the termlinkagebefore the discovery of DNA.
Early geneticists relied on observing phenotypic changes to understand an organism’s genotype. Shortly after Gregor Mendel
(the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what we now call genes, other researchers observed
that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by their location on
the same chromosome. Gene mapping relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to developing the first genetic maps.
Observations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of
crosses between parents with different traits. For example, in garden pea experiments, researchers discovered, that the flower’s
color and plant pollen’s shape were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the
same chromosome. We call exchanging DNA between homologous chromosome pairsgenetic recombination, which occurs by
crossing over DNA between homologous DNA strands, such as nonsister chromatids. Linkage analysis involves studying the
recombination frequency between any two genes. The greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a

two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis. If the recombination frequency between
two genes is less than 50 percent, they are linked.
Figure17.11Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome. Recombination between genesAandBis more frequent than
recombination between genesBandCbecause genesAandBare farther apart. Therefore, a crossover is more likely to occur between
them.
The generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains).
Scientists based early genetic maps on using known genes as markers. Scientists now use more sophisticated markers,
including those based on non-coding DNA, to compare individuals’ genomes in a population. Although individuals of a given
species are genetically similar, they are not identical. Every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in the
genome between individuals in a population are useful for genetic mapping purposes. In general, a good genetic marker is a
region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.
Some genetic markers that scientists use in generating genetic maps arerestriction fragment length polymorphisms(RFLP),
variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs),microsatellite polymorphisms, and thesingle nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs).
We can detect RFLPs (sometimes pronounced “rif-lips”) when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease
that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which we can then analyze using gel
electrophoresis. Every individual’s DNA will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction
endonucleases. Scientists sometimes refer to this as an individual’s DNA “fingerprint.” Certain chromosome regions that are
subject to polymorphism will lead to generating the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in
DNA’s non-coding regions. Non-coding, or “junk,” DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much
of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in regulating
coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in a population’s individual organisms. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar
to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.
Because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, natural increases or decreases in the
recombination level given genome area affects mapping. Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots; whereas,
others do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by
multiple methods.
Physical Maps
A physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides.
There are three methods scientists use to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence
mapping.Cytogenetic mappinguses information from microscopic analysis of stained chromosome sections (Figure 17.12). It is

## Section 308.2
Whole-Genome Sequencing
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe three types of sequencing
• Define whole-genome sequencing
Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some
diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to discover the root of the problem.Whole-genome sequencingis a
process that determines an entire genome’s DNA sequence. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem
solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and
interpret entire genomes.
For example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, the
doctor sequences only the DNA’s coding, exon-producing regions. In 2010, doctors used whole-exome sequencing to save a
young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally,
they performed whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell
death). The doctors used a bone-marrow transplant to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the
first person to receive successful treatment based on a whole-exome sequencing diagnosis. Today, human genome sequencing is
more readily available and results are available within two days for about $1000.
Strategies Used in Sequencing Projects
The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the
dideoxy method), which Fred Sanger developed in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-
stranded template by using a primer and a regulardeoxynucleotide(dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single DNA unit. The
primer and dNTP mix with a small proportion of fluorescently labeleddideoxynucleotides(ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are
monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (–OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain
(Figure 17.13). Scientists label each ddNTP with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP incorporates in the growing
complementary strand, it terminates the DNA replication process, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA

• Whole-Genome Sequencing 433
Originally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small
genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to developing double-barrel shotgun
sequencing, orpairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, scientists analyze each fragment’s end for overlap.
Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence
because there is more available information.
Next-generation Sequencing
Since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella ofnext-generation sequencing,
which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate
sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These
sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Comparing Sequences
A sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA. Scientists use it to identify similar regions between cell
types or species, which may indicate function or structure conservation. We can use sequence alignments to construct
phylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program calledBLAST (basic local alignment search tool)
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).
Under “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.” Input the following sequence into the large "query sequence" box:
ATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the "Species" field and type "human" or "Homo sapiens". Then click “BLAST” to
compare the inputted sequence against the human genome’s known sequences. The result is that this sequence occurs in over a
hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see a short
description of each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on "Graphics". This will bring you to
a page that shows the sequence’s location within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag
back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected sequence by
clicking the "ATG" button.
Use of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms
British biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Fred Sanger used a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs), to
completely sequence the first genome. Other scientists later sequenced several other organelle and viral genomes. American
biotechnologist, biochemist, geneticist, and businessman Craig Venter sequenced the bacteriumHaemophilus influenzaein the
1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on sequencing the genome of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae,
which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome sequencing. By 1997, the
genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacteriumEscherichia coliK12 and the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now know the genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouseMus musculus, the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster, the nematodeCaenorhabditis. elegans, and humansHomo sapiens. Researchers perform extensive
basic research in model organisms because they can apply the information to genetically similar organisms. Amodel organism
is a species that researchers use as a model to understand the biological processes in other species that the model organism
represents. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The process of
attaching biological information to gene sequences isgenome annotation. Annotating gene sequences helps with basic
experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets.

Applying Genomics
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain pharmacogenomics
• Define polygenic
Introducing DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded
the applicability of DNA sequence information. Many fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial
genomics are using genomics. Understanding and finding cures for diseases is the most common application of genomics.
Predicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level
Predicting disease risk involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Health care
professionals can recommend intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs before disease onset. However, this approach is
most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of
diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored orpolygenic, which is a
phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010,
scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford
University, who had his genome sequenced. The analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. The medical team
performed a risk assessment to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. The team found a rare
genetic mutation, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. The results also predicted that Quake had a 23 percent
risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The scientists used databases and several
publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools
are becoming more reliable, researchers still must address ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level.

in urine is indicative of prostate cancer. ThePCA3test is a better indicator of cancer than the more well known PSA test, which measures
the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.
In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for
prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate
cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side
effects. ThePCA3test is more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer
itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men receive prostate cancer screenings using
thePCA3or PSA test? Should people in general receive screenings to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other
diseases?
Pharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics
Pharmacogenomics, or toxicogenomics, involves evaluating drug effectiveness and safety on the basis of information from an
individual's genomic sequence. We can study genomic responses to drugs using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats
or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could
provide information about the transcription profile in the drug's presence, which we can use as an early indicator of the
potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to
cancerous cell growth. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Medical professionals can
use personal genome sequence information to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of
the individual patient’s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but medical professionals can test them
further before pathologic symptoms arise.
Microbial Genomics: Metagenomics
Traditionally, scholars have taught microbiology with the view that it is best to study microorganisms underpure culture
conditions. This involves isolating a single cell type and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through
several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In
addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist culturing in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities,
but in microbial communities or biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study
microorganisms.Metagenomicsis the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an
environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on
the environment (Figure 17.16).

## Section 311.2
Genomics and Proteomics
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain systems biology
• Describe a proteome
• Define protein signature
Proteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function that the gene encodes. Amino acids comprise proteins
and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of
reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help
transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state,
protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.
Aproteomeis the entire set of proteins that a cell type produces. We can study proteoms using the knowledge of genomes
because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction, not all
mRNAs are translated into proteins.Proteomicsis the study of proteomes' function. Proteomics complements genomics and is
useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that they based on genes. Even though all multicellular organisms' cells have
the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the
genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced
(cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins modify themselves after translation by
processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein
interactions, which complicate studying proteomes. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends
on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.
Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics.Metabolomicsinvolves studying small molecule metabolites in an
organism. Themetabolomeis the complete set of metabolites that are related to an organism's genetic makeup. Metabolomics
offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental
factors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all the metabolites in living organisms' tissues
and fluids.
Basic Techniques in Protein Analysis
The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions,
study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. Just as
scientists analyze the genome using the basic DNA sequencing technique, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis.
The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry identifies and
determines a molecule's characteristics. Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small protein
samples. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine a protein crystal's three-dimensional structure at
atomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), uses atoms' magnetic properties to
determine the protein's three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution. Scientists have also used protein microarrays to study
protein interactions. Large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.17) have provided the basis for protein
microarrays. Scientists use computer software to analyze the vast amount of data for proteomic analysis.
Genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part ofsystems biology, which is the study of whole biological systems (genomes
and proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome
Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data.
Because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to
compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes. Most pharmaceutical
drug trials target proteins. Researchers use information that they obtain from proteomics to identify novel drugs and to
understand their mechanisms of action.

Understanding Evolution
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how scientists developed the present-day theory of evolution
• Define adaptation
• Explain convergent and divergent evolution
• Describe homologous and vestigial structures
• Discuss misconceptions about the theory of evolution
Evolution by natural selection describes a mechanism for how species change over time. Scientists,
philosophers, researchers, and others had made suggestions and debated this topic well before Darwin
began to explore this idea. Classical Greek philosopher Plato emphasized in his writings that species were
static and unchanging, yet there were also ancient Greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas. In the
eighteenth century, naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon reintroduced ideas about the
evolution of animals and observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal
populations, even when the environments are similar. Some at this time also accepted that there were
extinct species.
Also during the eighteenth century, James Hutton, a Scottish geologist and naturalist, proposed that
geological change occurred gradually by accumulating small changes from processes operating like they are
today over long periods of time. This contrasted with the predominant view that the planet's geology was a
consequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past. Nineteenth century geologist
Charles Lyell popularized Hutton's view. A friend to Darwin. Lyell’s ideas were influential on Darwin’s
thinking: Lyell’s notion of the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the
process of change provided an analogy for this change. In the early nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste
Lamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change. We now refer to this
mechanism as an inheritance of acquired characteristics by which the environment causes modifications in
an individual, or offspring could use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, and thus bring about change
in a species. While many discredited this mechanism for evolutionary change, Lamarck’s ideas were an
important influence on evolutionary thought.
Charles Darwin and Natural Selection
In the mid-nineteenth century, two naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, independently
conceived and described the actual mechanism for evolution. Importantly, each naturalist spent time
exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the
world onH.M.S. Beagle, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace
traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago
from 1854 to 1862. Darwin’s journey, like Wallace’s later journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at
several island chains, the last being the Galápagos Islands west of Ecuador. On these islands, Darwin
observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. For
example, the ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak
shape (Figure 18.2). The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small
differences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species
on the South American mainland. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from
one of the original mainland species. Upon further study, he realized that each finch's varied beaks helped
the birds acquire a specific type of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for
breaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.

Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation
for how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection.Natural selection, or “survival
of the fittest,” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of
those traits. This leads to evolutionary change.
For example, Darwin observed a population of giant tortoises in the Galápagos Archipelago to have longer necks than those that
lived on other islands with dry lowlands. These tortoises were “selected” because they could reach more leaves and access more
food than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves
had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn’t reach the food source. Consequently, long-necked tortoises would
be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring. Over time, only long-necked
tortoises would be present in the population.
Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most
characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and Wallace,
knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than are able to
survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the
availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation. Both
Darwin and Wallace’s understanding of this principle came from reading economist Thomas Malthus' essay that explained this
principle in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those
variations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best
compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to
compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to
change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection
leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment. It is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.
In 1858, Darwin and Wallace (Figure 18.3) presented papers at the Linnean Society in London that discussed the idea of natural
selection. The following year Darwin’s book,On the Origin of Species,was published. His book outlined in considerable detail
his arguments for evolution by natural selection.

One objective of many field biologists includes discovering new, unrecorded species. Not only do such findings expand our
understanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important innovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture. Plant
and microbial species, in particular, can reveal new medicinal and nutritive knowledge. Other organisms can play key roles in
ecosystems or if rare require protection. When discovered, researchers can use these important species as evidence for
environmental regulations and laws.
Processes and Patterns of Evolution
Natural selection can only take place if there isvariation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these
differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical
because nongenetic reasons can cause variation among individuals such as an individual's height because of better nutrition
rather than different genes.
Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in
DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes that mutation causes
can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation affects the organism's phenotype in a way that gives it reduced
fitness—lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness.
Many mutations will also have no effect on the phenotype's fitness. We call these neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a
whole range of effect sizes on the organism's fitness that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect.
Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to
produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring.
We call a heritable trait that helps an organism's survival and reproduction in its present environment anadaptation. Scientists
describe groups of organisms adapting to their environment when a genetic variation occurs over time that increases or
maintains the population's “fit” to its environment. A platypus's webbed feet are an adaptation for swimming. A snow leopard's
thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. A cheetah's fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.
Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the current environmental conditions. The same traits are not always selected
because environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a plant species that grew in a moist climate and did not
need to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun. Large
leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support
large leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water. The direction of natural
selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive
the new environmental conditions.
The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of
organisms that become tremendously different from each other. We call two species that evolve in diverse directions from a

changed. An artist’s rendition of (b) extinct species of the genusEquusreveals that these ancient species resembled the modern horse
(Equus ferus) but varied in size.
Anatomy and Embryology
Another type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form. For example,
the bones in human, dog, bird, and whale appendages all share the same overall construction (Figure 18.7) resulting from their
origin in a common ancestor's appendages. Over time, evolution led to changes in the bones' shapes and sizes different species,
but they have maintained the same overall layout. Scientists call these synonymous partshomologous structures.
Figure18.7The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.
Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common
ancestor. We call these unused structures without functionvestigial structures. Other examples of vestigial structures are wings
on flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales. Not all similarities represent homologous structures. As
explained inDetermining Evolutionary Relationships, when similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints
and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is an analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and
birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin are completely different. These are analogous structures (Figure 20.8).

Another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. For example, species of
unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan, living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white
phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice (Figure 18.8). These similarities occur not because of common
ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures—the benefits of predators not seeing them.

accepted it, particularly younger biologists, within 20 years after publication ofOn theOrigin of Species. Nevertheless, the
theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound.
LINK TO LEARNING
Thissite(http://openstax.org/l/misconceptions)addresses some of the main misconceptions associated with the theory of
evolution.
Evolution Is Just a Theory
Critics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word “theory”
with the way scientists use the word. In science, we understand a “theory” to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified
explanations for a set of observations of the natural world. Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the
theory of relativity, each which describes understood facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of evolution describes
facts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists. In contrast,
a “theory” in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation. This meaning is more akin to the
scientific concept of “hypothesis.” When critics of evolution say it is “just a theory,” they are implying that there is little evidence
supporting it and that it is still in the process of rigorous testing. This is a mischaracterization.
Individuals Evolve
Evolution is the change in a population's genetic composition over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential
reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is development and
involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual’s
environment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average
value of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium
ground finches in the Galápagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. If one measures the
average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures them in the population several years
later, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. Although some individuals may survive from the first time to
the second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals who contribute to the shift in
average bill size.
Evolution Explains the Origin of Life
It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life’s origins. Conversely, some of the theory’s critics
believe that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of evolution
explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. It does not shed light on the beginnings
of life including the origins of the first cells, which define life. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth
precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on Earth can repeat themselves because the intermediate stages would
immediately become food for existing living things.
However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these
entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the
expense of inefficient reproducers. While evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some
of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.
Organisms Evolve on Purpose
Statements such as “organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment” are quite common, but such statements can
lead to two types of misunderstandings. First, do not interpret the statement to mean that individual organisms evolve. The
statement is shorthand for “a population evolves in response to a changing environment.” However, a second misunderstanding
may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional. A changed environment results in
some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more
offspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined.
It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise
in response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select a
population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which a gene causes, did not arise by mutation because of
applying the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the bacteria's gene pool, likely at a low frequency. The
antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define species and describe how scientists identify species as different
• Describe genetic variables that lead to speciation
• Identify prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers
• Explain allopatric and sympatric speciation
• Describe adaptive radiation
Although all life on earth shares various genetic similarities, only certain organisms combine genetic information by sexual
reproduction and have offspring that can then successfully reproduce. Scientists call such organisms members of the same
biological species.
Species and the Ability to Reproduce
Aspeciesis a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. According to this definition,
one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species
to produce fertile offspring.
Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA. The closer
relationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People’s DNA is likely
to be more like their father or mother’s DNA than their cousin or grandparent’s DNA. Organisms of the same species have the
highest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction.
Species’ appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic dogs
(Canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce
viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (Figure 18.9).
Figure18.9The (a) poodle and (b) cocker spaniel can reproduce to produce a breed known as (c) the cockapoo. (credit a: modification of
work by Sally Eller, Tom Reese; credit b: modification of work by Jeremy McWilliams; credit c: modification of work by Kathleen Conklin)
In other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though
bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a
separate species group (Figure 18.10). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize a bald eagle's egg with an African fish
eagle's sperm and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called ahybrid(a cross between two species), would probably be
infertile—unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active
in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. Thus, even

though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.

(credit a: modification of work by Nigel Wedge; credit b: modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)
Populations of species share a gene pool: a collection of all the gene variants in the species. Again, the basis to any changes in a
group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. When variations occur
within a species, they can only pass to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual
reproduction. The change will pass on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. For the changed trait
to pass on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait. In other words,
sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a
sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore,
reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. In short, organisms must be able
to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.
Speciation
The biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actual or potential
interbreeding individuals. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible
and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. The presence in nature of hybrids
between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process
may not yet be completed.
Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms forspeciation: the formation of two species
from one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only
illustration inOn theOrigin of Species(Figure 18.11a). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution (Figure
18.11), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as
the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.

Figure18.12The northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl inhabit geographically separate locations with different climates and
ecosystems. The owl is an example of allopatric speciation. (credit "northern spotted owl": modification of work by John and Karen
Hollingsworth; credit "Mexican spotted owl": modification of work by Bill Radke)
Additionally, scientists have found that the further the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the more
likely it is that speciation will occur. This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors
would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate is cooler
than in the south. The types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits. Also, the hunting habits and
prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and
speciation likely will occur.
Adaptive Radiation
In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat.
Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. We call
thisadaptive radiationbecause many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into
several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because
water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms. The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates
one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the six

Figure18.14Aneuploidy results when the gametes have too many or too few chromosomes due to nondisjunction during meiosis. In this
example, the resulting offspring will have 2n+1 or 2n-1 chromosomes.
Which is most likely to survive, offspring with 2n+1 chromosomes or offspring with 2n-1 chromosomes?
Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified two
main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. Reproductive isolation is
the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its
own species in a condition that we callautopolyploidy(Figure 18.15). The prefix “auto-” means “self,” so the term means multiple
chromosomes from one’s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into
one cell instead of separating.
Figure18.15Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.
For example, if a plant species with 2n= 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2n= 6, when they should ben=
3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible with the
normal gametes that this plant species produces. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other
autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by
forming offspring with 4nthat we call a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of
this new kind and not those of the ancestral species.
The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring that we call
anallopolyploid. The prefix “allo-” means “other” (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from
two different species combine.Figure 18.16illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form. Notice how it takes two

In some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer
overlaps with the same species' other populations. We call this situationhabitat isolation. Reproduction with the parent species
ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. For example, a cricket population that
was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, natural selection forces, mutation, and genetic
drift will likely result in the two groups diverging (Figure 18.18).
Figure18.18Speciation can occur when two populations occupy different habitats. The habitats need not be far apart. The cricket (a)
Gryllus pennsylvanicusprefers sandy soil, and the cricket (b)Gryllus firmusprefers loamy soil. The two species can live in close proximity,
but because of their different soil preferences, they became genetically isolated.
Behavioral isolationoccurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction. For example, male
fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various firefly species display their lights differently. If a male of one
species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male.
Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place.
We call this agametic barrier. Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures
simply do not fit together. For example, damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs. If one
species tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together. (Figure 18.19).
Figure18.19The shape of the male reproductive organ varies among male damselfly species, and is only compatible with the female of
that species. Reproductive organ incompatibility keeps the species reproductively isolated.
In plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from accessing
the pollen. The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which prevents the
plant from cross-pollinating with a different species (Figure 18.20).
Figure18.20Some flowers have evolved to attract certain pollinators. The (a) wide foxglove flower is adapted for pollination by bees, while
the (b) long, tube-shaped trumpet creeper flower is adapted for pollination by hummingbirds.

Reconnection and Speciation Rates
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe pathways of species evolution in hybrid zones
• Explain the two major theories on rates of speciation
Speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which the
closely related species continue to interact.
Reconnection
After speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely. Individual organisms will mate with any
nearby individual with whom they are capable of breeding. We call an area where two closely related species continue to interact
and reproduce, forming hybrids ahybrid zone. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids
and the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.22). If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, speciation reinforcement occurs, and the
species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion
occurs and the two species become one. Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and
hybridization continues.

• Reconnection and Speciation Rates 461
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure18.22After speciation has occurred, the two separate but closely related species may continue to produce offspring in an area
called the hybrid zone. Reinforcement, fusion, or stability may result, depending on reproductive barriers and the relative fitness of the
hybrids.
If two species eat a different diet but one of the food sources is eliminated and both species are forced to eat the same foods,
what change in the hybrid zone is most likely to occur?
Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such
reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process we callreinforcement. Scientists use
this term because the hybrids' low success reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents,
the two species may fuse back into one species (Figure 18.23). Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will
remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some individuals. Scientists classify this as stability because no real net
change is taking place.
Varying Rates of Speciation
Scientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the fossil
record. As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models to help explain
speciation rates. In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, we can observe two current patterns: gradual speciation model and
punctuated equilibrium model.
In thegradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. In thepunctuated equilibriummodel, a
new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time
afterward (Figure 18.23). We call this early change model punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or
periodic change and then remains in balance afterward. While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not
necessarily exclude gradualism.

• Population Evolution 469
TheIBandI0alleles comprise 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100
percent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.
The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become
more widespread than others during the natural selection process. Natural selection can alter the population’s genetic makeup.
An example is if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. Because
many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more
offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the
population. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the
allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. Thegene
poolis the sum of all the alleles in a population.
Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele
frequencies. We call this phenomenon genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in
populations and are not isolated events. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to
determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. We call an event that initiates an allele frequency change
in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, thefounder effect. Natural selection,
random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in a population's genome.
Hardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium
In the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated the
principle of equilibrium to describe the population's genetic makeup. The theory, which later became known as the Hardy-
Weinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable— unless some
kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change. The
Hardy-Weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against
genotype, plus an infinite population. While no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model
against which to compare real population changes.
Working under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical
models. The variable p, for example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say Y for the trait of yellow in Mendel’s
peas, while the variable q represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color green. If these are the only two possible
alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles comprise all of the alleles
for that locus in the population.
However, what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting
genotypes, known as the population’sgenetic structure, from which scientists can surmise phenotype distribution. If we
observe the phenotype, we can know only the homozygous recessive allele's genotype. The calculations provide an estimate of the
remaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if we know the allele frequencies (p and q), predicting
the genotypes' frequencies is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability of obtaining these genotypes if we
draw two alleles at random from the gene pool. In the above scenario, an individual pea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce
yellow peas; pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus produce green peas (Figure 19.2). In other words, the frequency of pp
individuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the frequency of qq individuals is q2. Again, if p and q are
the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population, these genotypes frequencies will sum to one: p2+ 2pq + q2= 1.

Population Genetics
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the different types of variation in a population
• Explain why only natural selection can act upon heritable variation
• Describe genetic drift and the bottleneck effect
• Explain how each evolutionary force can influence a population's allele frequencies
A population's individuals often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of a particular gene, which scientists
refer to as polymorphisms. We call populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics polymorphic. A number
of factors, including the population’s genetic structure and the environment (Figure 19.3) influencepopulation variation, the
distribution of phenotypes among individuals. Understanding phenotypic variation sources in a population is important for
determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures.

Genetic Variance
Natural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits, namely an organism’s genetic code.
Because alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected, while
deleterious alleles may not. Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. For example, if an athlete works out in the gym
every day, building up muscle strength, the athlete’s offspring will not necessarily grow up to be a body builder. If there is a
genetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, a parent may pass this to a child.
LINK TO LEARNING
Before Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized that
organisms could inherit acquired traits. While the majority of scientists have not supported this hypothesis, some have recently
begun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong. Visit thissite(http://openstax.org/l/epigenetic)to learn more.
Heritabilityis the fraction of phenotype variation that we can attribute to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among
individuals in a population. The greater the heritability of a population’s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the
evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation.
We call the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a populationgenetic variance. When scientists are involved in the breeding
of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population’s genetic variance to preserve as
much of the phenotypic diversity as possible. This also helps reduce associated risks ofinbreeding, the mating of closely related
individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause

Figure19.4Genetic drift in a population can lead to eliminating an allele from a population by chance. In this example, rabbits with the
brown coat color allele (B) are dominant over rabbits with the white coat color allele (b). In the first generation, the two alleles occur with
equal frequency in the population, resulting in p and q values of .5. Only half of the individuals reproduce, resulting in a second generation
with p and q values of .7 and .3, respectively. Only two individuals in the second generation reproduce, and by chance these individuals are
homozygous dominant for brown coat color. As a result, in the third generation the recessiveballele is lost.
Do you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on the mainland?
Small populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift. Large populations, alternatively, are buffered against the
effects of chance. If one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young age before it leaves any offspring
to the next generation, all of its genes—1/10 of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that’s

## Section 336.1
• Population Genetics 475
Background:When an earthquake or hurricane suddenly wipes out much of a population, the surviving individuals are usually
a random sampling of the original group. As a result, the population's genetic makeup can change dramatically. We call this
phenomenon the bottleneck effect.
Hypothesis:Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each time one runs this
experiment the results will vary.
Test the hypothesis:Count out the original population using different colored beads. For example, red, blue, and yellow beads
might represent red, blue, and yellow individuals. After recording the number of each individual in the original population,
place them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a few beads out at a time. Then, pour 1/3 of the bottle’s contents
into a bowl. This represents the surviving individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. Count the
number of the different colored beads in the bowl, and record it. Then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the
experiment four more times.
Analyze the data:Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment. Do the populations all contain the same
number of different colored beads, or do they vary? Remember, these populations all came from the same exact parent
population.
Form a conclusion:Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically. This is because natural disasters are
not selective—they kill and spare individuals at random. Now think about how this might affect a real population. What
happens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast? How do the seabirds that live on the beach fare?
Gene Flow
Another important evolutionary force isgene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of
individuals or gametes (Figure 19.6). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants, for
example, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some distance
away. Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share of
immigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated females.
This variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the population's gene structure, but it can also
introduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats.
Figure19.6Gene flow can occur when an individual travels from one geographic location to another.
Mutation
Mutations are changes to an organism’s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve because of
mutations accumulating over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and
phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural
selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is
determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and
can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting
phenotype.

## Section 337.1
Adaptive Evolution
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain the different ways natural selection can shape populations
• Describe how these different forces can lead to different outcomes in terms of the population variation
Natural selection acts on the population’s heritable traits: selecting for beneficial alleles that allow for environmental adaptation,
and thus increasing their frequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their
frequency. Scientists call this processadaptive evolution. Natural selection acts on entire organisms, not on an individual allele
within the organism. An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases
the ability to reproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that
fecundity phenotype will not pass to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age. Natural

## Section 337.2
• Adaptive Evolution 477
selection acts at the individual's level. It selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next
generation. Scientists call this an organism’sevolutionary (Darwinian) fitness.
Fitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. However, it is not an individual's absolute fitness that
counts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. Scientists call this conceptrelative fitness, which
allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how
the population might evolve.
There are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying
selection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a
population, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes can become more similar or more
disparate.
Stabilizing Selection
If natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergostabilizing
selection(Figure 19.8). In a mouse population that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor mice that
best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely for predators to spot. Assuming the ground is a fairly consistent shade of
brown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their
genes for their brown coat. Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker will stand out against the ground
and be more likely to fall victim to predation. As a result of this selection, the population’s genetic variance will decrease.
Directional Selection
When the environment changes, populations will often undergodirectional selection(Figure 19.8), which selects for phenotypes
at one end of the spectrum of existing variation. A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth
in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were predominately light in color,
which allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment. However, as soot began spewing
from factories, the trees darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot. Over time, the
frequency of the moth's melanic form increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution
because their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees. Similarly, the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on
a different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color. The result of this type of
selection is a shift in the population’s genetic variance toward the new, fit phenotype.
LINK TO LEARNING
In science, we sometimes believe some things are true, and then new information becomes available that changes our
understanding. The peppered moth story is an example: some scientists recently have questioned the facts behind the selection
toward darker moths. Read thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/peppered_moths)to learn more.
Diversifying Selection
Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages for natural selection, while the intermediate
phenotypes are, on average, less fit. Scientists call thisdiversifying selection(Figure 19.8) We see this in many animal
populations that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males use brute force to obtain mates, while small males can
sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male’s territory. In this case, both the alpha males and the
“sneaking” males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, who can’t overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak
copulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either
end of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a mouse population living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed
with patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-
colored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, alternatively would not blend in with either the grass or the sand,
and thus predators would most likely eat them. The result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population
becomes more diverse.

Figure19.9A yellow-throated side-blotched lizard is smaller than either the blue-throated or orange-throated males and appears a bit like
the females of the species, allowing it to sneak copulations. (credit: “tinyfroglet”/Flickr)
In this scenario, natural selection favors orange males when blue males dominate the population. Blue males will thrive when
the population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are the most populous. As a
result, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes—in one generation, orange might
predominate, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. Once yellow males comprise a majority of the population,
blue males will be selected. Finally, when blue males become common, orange males once again will be favored.
Negative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the population’s genetic variance by selecting for rare phenotypes;
whereas, positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common phenotypes.
Sexual Selection
Males and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs. Males
are often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacock’s tail, while females tend to be
smaller and duller in decoration. We call such differencessexual dimorphisms(Figure 19.10), which arise in many populations,
particularly animal populations, where there is more variance in the male's reproductive success than that of the females. That
is, some males—often the bigger, stronger, or more decorated males—obtain the vast majority of the total matings, while others
receive none. This can occur because the males are better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with
the bigger or more decorated males. In either case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure
among males to obtain those matings, resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to attract the
females’ attention. Females, however, tend to achieve a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select
more desirable males.
Sexual dimorphism varies widely among species, and some species are even sex-role reversed. In such cases, females tend to
have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the bigger body size and
elaborate traits usually characteristic of males.

colored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals who began moving in that direction (began
selection for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light.
Finally, it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive. While natural selection selects the fittest individuals and
often results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do the
opposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the population’s gene pool. Evolution has no purpose—it is not changing a
population into a preconceived ideal. It is simply the sum of the various forces that we have described in this chapter and how
they influence the population's genetic and phenotypic variance.

Organizing Life on Earth
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the need for a comprehensive classification system
• List the different levels of the taxonomic classification system
• Describe how systematics and taxonomy relate to phylogeny
• Discuss a phylogenetic tree's components and purpose
In scientific terms,phylogenyis the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of
organisms. A phylogeny describes the organisim's relationships, such as from which organisms it may have
evolved, or to which species it is most closely related. Phylogenetic relationships provide information on
shared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different.
Phylogenetic Trees
Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among
organisms. Aphylogenetic treeis a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or
groups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since
one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, we can construct a “tree of life” to
illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms
(Figure 20.2).
Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, we can read a phylogenetic tree like a map of evolutionary
history. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor.
Scientists call such treesrooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the
bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic
tree that the three domains— Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—diverge from a single point and branch off.
The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and
miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees do not show a common ancestor
but do show relationships among species.
Figure20.2Both of these phylogenetic trees show the relationship of the three domains of life—Bacteria, Archaea,
and Eukarya—but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor
while the (b) unrooted tree does not. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Gaba)
In a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships (Figure 20.3). The point where a split
occurs, abranch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. We call a lineage
that evolved early from the root that remains unbranched abasal taxon. We call two lineages stemming
from the same branch pointsister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is apolytomyand serves to
illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships. Note that although sister
taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from
each other. Organisms in two taxa may have split at a specific branch point, but neither taxon gave rise to the
other.

## Section 344.2
• Organizing Life on Earth 487
Figure20.3A phylogenetic tree's root indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree. A branch point indicates
where two lineages diverged. A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal taxon. When two lineages stem from the same
branch point, they are sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy.
The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. We can trace the pathway from the origin of
life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a
single species and tracing back towards the "trunk" of the tree, one can discover species' ancestors, as well as where lineages
share a common ancestry. In addition, we can use the tree to study entire groups of organisms.
Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For
example, if a branch point rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because each taxon's
evolution from the branch point was independent of the other.
Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these
disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life.”Systematicsis the field that scientists
use to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships. Researchers may use data from fossils, from
studying the body part structures, or molecules that an organism uses, and DNA analysis. By combining data from many
sources, scientists can construct an organism's phylogeny Since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change
as researchers discover new types of life and learn new information.
Limitations of Phylogenetic Trees
It may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not always
true. If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings, it is possible for the two groups to appear
more different than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree inFigure 20.4shows that
lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs; whereas, frogs do not. Yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and
rabbits.
Figure20.4An organism that lacked a vertebral column roots this ladder-like phylogenetic tree of vertebrates. At each branch point,
scientists place organisms with different characters in different groups based on shared characteristics.

## Section 346.1
Determining Evolutionary Relationships
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Compare homologous and analogous traits
• Discuss the purpose of cladistics
• Describe maximum parsimony
Scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections among organisms. Similar to
detective work, scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts. In the case of phylogeny, evolutionary investigations focus on
two types of evidence: morphologic (form and function) and genetic.
Two Options for Similarities
In general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes are more closely related than those that do not. We refer
to such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically as homologous structures. They stem from
developmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in bat and bird wings have homologous
structures (Figure 20.7).
Figure20.7Bat and bird wings are homologous structures, indicating that bats and birds share a common evolutionary past. (credit a:
modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by U.S. DOI BLM)
Notice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. The more complex the
feature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two people from different countries
both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared knowledge.
That outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two people both invented a hammer, we can reasonably conclude that
both could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same relationship between complexity and shared
evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms.
Misleading Appearances
Some organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference to
make them look quite different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. This
usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions.
When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is
ananalogyor homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin
is completely different. These are analogous structures (Figure 20.8).

## Section 346.2
• Determining Evolutionary Relationships 491
Similar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin. Analogous
organs have a similar function. For example, the bones in a whale's front flipper are homologous to the bones in the human arm.
These structures are not analogous. A butterfly or bird's wings are analogous but not homologous. Some structures are both
analogous and homologous: bird and bat wings are both homologous and analogous. Scientists must determine which type of
similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the organisms' phylogeny.
Figure20.8The (c) wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a (b) bird wing and (a) bat wing, and it serves the same function. However, the
honeybee wing is not composed of bones and has a distinctly different structure and embryonic origin. These wing types (insect versus bat
and bird) illustrate an analogy—similar structures that do not share an evolutionary history. (credit a: modification of work by U.S. DOI BLM;

LINK TO LEARNING
Thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/relationships)has several examples to show how appearances can be misleading in
understanding organisms' phylogenetic relationships.
Molecular Comparisons
The advancement of DNA technology has given rise tomolecular systematics, which is use of molecular data in taxonomy and
biological geography (biogeography). New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also
uncover previously made errors. As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can be tricky to read in some cases. For
some situations, two very closely related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation occurred that caused a shift in the
genetic code. Inserting or deleting a mutation would move each nucleotide base over one place, causing two similar codes to
appear unrelated.
Sometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in the same
locations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not. For both of these situations, computer
technologies help identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of both morphologic and molecular
information is more effective in determining phylogeny.

## Section 347.1
• Determining Evolutionary Relationships 493
Building Phylogenetic Trees
How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? After they sort the homologous and analogous traits, scientists often organize
the homologous traits usingcladistics. This system sorts organisms into clades: groups of organisms that descended from a
single ancestor. For example, inFigure 20.10, all the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had
amniotic eggs. Consequently, these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, or amonophyletic group.
Clades must include all descendants from a branch point.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure20.10Lizards, rabbits, and humans all descend from a common ancestor that had an amniotic egg. Thus, lizards, rabbits, and
humans all belong to the clade Amniota. Vertebrata is a larger clade that also includes fish and lamprey.
Which animals in this figure belong to a clade that includes animals with hair? Which evolved first, hair or the amniotic egg?
Clades can vary in size depending on which branch point one references. The important factor is that all organisms in the clade
or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. You can remember this because monophyletic breaks down into
“mono,” meaning one, and “phyletic,” meaning evolutionary relationship.Figure 20.11shows various clade examples. Notice how
each clade comes from a single point; whereas, the non-clade groups show branches that do not share a single point.

homologies and analogies, makes the task of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily difficult. Add to that advancing
DNA technology, which now provides large quantities of genetic sequences for researchers to use and analzye. Taxonomy is a
subjective discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so each taxonomist will decide the order of
connections.
To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately, scientists often use the concept ofmaximum parsimony,
which means that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way. For example, if a group of people entered a forest preserve
to hike, based on the principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most would hike on established trails rather than
forge new ones.
For scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used: the pathway of evolution probably includes the fewest
major events that coincide with the evidence at hand. Starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of organisms,
scientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those traits.

people seem to be more closely related to fungi than fungi are to plants. Sound unbelievable? As the information about DNA
sequences grows, scientists will become closer to mapping the evolutionary history of all life on Earth.

phylogenetic tree concept
Phylogenetic modeling concepts are constantly changing. It is one of the most dynamic fields of study in all biology. Over the
last several decades, new research has challenged scientists’ ideas about how organisms are related. The scientific community
has proposed new models of these relationships.
Many phylogenetic trees are models of the evolutionary relationship among species. Phylogenetic trees originated with Charles
Darwin, who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 (Figure 20.12a). This served as a prototype for subsequent studies for
more than a century. The phylogenetic tree concept with a single trunk representing a common ancestor, with the branches
representing the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure of many common trees, such as the oak
(Figure 20.12b). However, evidence from modern DNA sequence analysis and newly developed computer algorithms has caused
skepticism about the standard tree model's validity in the scientific community.

HGT in Prokaryotes
HGT mechanisms are quite common in the Bacteria and Archaea domains, thus significantly changing the way scientists view
their evolution. The majority of evolutionary models, such as in the Endosymbiont Theory, propose that eukaryotes descended
from multiple prokaryotes, which makes HGT all the more important to understanding the phylogenetic relationships of all
extant and extinct species. The Endosymbiont Theory purports that the eukaryotes' mitochondria and the green plants'
chloroplasts and flagellates originated as free-living prokaryotes that invaded primitive eukaryotic cells and become established
as permanent symbionts in the cytoplasm.
Microbiology students are well aware that genes transfer among common bacteria. These gene transfers between species are the
major mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics. Classically, scientists believe that three different
mechanisms drive such transfers.
1. Transformation: bacteria takes up naked DNA
2. Transduction: a virus transfers the genes
3. Conjugation: a hollow tube, or pilus transfers genes between organisms
More recently, scientists have discovered a fourth gene transfer mechanism between prokaryotes. Small, virus-like particles, or
gene transfer agents (GTAs)transfer random genomic segments from one prokaryote species to another. GTAs are responsible
for genetic changes, sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes. Scientists characterized the
first GTA in 1974 using purple, non-sulfur bacteria. These GTAs, which are most likely derived from bacteriophage DNA inserted
in a prokaryote that lost the ability to produce new bacteriophages, carry random DNA pieces from one organism to another.
Controlled studies using marine bacteria have demonstrated GTAs' ability to act with high frequency. Scientists have estimated
gene transfer events in marine prokaryotes, either by GTAs or by viruses, to be as high as 1013per year in the Mediterranean Sea
alone. GTAs and viruses are efficient HGT vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic evolution.
As a consequence of this modern DNA analysis, the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from Archaea has fallen out of favor.
While eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria, such as the TATA box (located in many genes' promoter
region), the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with bacterial DNA than Archaea DNA made this idea
less tenable. Furthermore, scientists have proposed genome fusion from Archaea and Bacteria by endosymbiosis as the ultimate
event in eukaryotic evolution.
HGT in Eukaryotes
Although it is easy to see how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by HGT, scientists initially thought that this process was
absent in eukaryotes. After all, prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their environment; whereas, the multicellular
organisms' sex cells are usually sequestered in protected parts of the body. It follows from this idea that the gene transfers
between multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult. Scientists believe this process is rarer in eukaryotes and has a much
smaller evolutionary impact than in prokaryotes. In spite of this, HGT between distantly related organisms is evident in several

they contain two lipid bilayer membranes, resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial species. The double
membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second membrane from the
host as it was internalized. Scientists have also used this mechanism to explain the double membranes in mitochondria and
chloroplasts. Lake’s work is not without skepticism, and the biological science community still debates his ideas. In addition to
Lake’s hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin of eukaryotes. How did the eukaryotic nucleus
evolve? One theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome.
Some bacteria have the DNA enclosed by two membranes; however, there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores. Other
proteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes. If the eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of
the two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to eukaryotes.
Figure20.14The scientific community now widely accepts the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are endosymbiotic in origin. More
controversial is the proposal that (a) the eukaryotic nucleus resulted from fusing archaeal and bacterial genomes, and that (b) Gram-
negative bacteria, which have two membranes, resulted from fusing Archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, each of which has a single
membrane.
Thenucleus-firsthypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first (Figure 20.15a), followed by a later fusion of
the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria. Themitochondria-firsthypothesis proposes that mitochondria
were first established in a prokaryotic host (Figure 20.15b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion or other
mechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell. Most interestingly, theeukaryote-firsthypothesis proposes that prokaryotes
actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity (Figure 20.15c). All of these hypotheses are testable. Only time
and more experimentation will determine which hypothesis data best supports.

Ring of Life Models
Others have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called “ring of life”
(Figure 20.17). This is a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes. Lake,
again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three
domains—Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya—evolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes. His laboratory proposes
that this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the ring model is
the only one that adequately takes HGT and genomic fusion into account. However, other phylogeneticists remain highly
skeptical of this model.
Figure20.17According to the “ring of life” phylogenetic model, the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.
In summary, we must modify Darwin's “tree of life” model to include HGT. Does this mean abandoning the tree model
completely? Even Lake argues that scientists should attempt to modify the tree model to allow it to accurately fit his data, and
only the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal.
This doesn’t mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships of life.
A consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwin’s original phylogenetic tree concept is too
simple, but made sense based on what scientists knew at the time. However, the search for a more useful model moves on: each
model serves as hypotheses to test with the possibility of developing new models. This is how science advances. Researchers use
these models as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships and understand the massive amount of
data that requires analysis.

adapt, much less is known about how viruses originated in the first place. When exploring the evolutionary history of most
organisms, scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence. However, viruses do not fossilize, as far as we
know, so researchers must extrapolate from investigations of how today’s viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic
information to create speculative virus histories.
Most scholars agree that viruses don’t have a single common ancestor, nor is there a single reasonable hypothesis about virus
origins. There are current evolutionary scenarios that may explain the origin of viruses. One such hypothesis, the “devolution” or
theregressive hypothesis, suggests that viruses evolved from free-living cells, or from intracellular prokaryotic parasites.
However, many components of how this process might have occurred remain a mystery. A second hypothesis, the escapist or the
progressive hypothesis, suggests that viruses originated from RNA and DNA molecules, or self-replicating entities similar to
transposons or other mobile genetic elements, that escaped from a host cell with the ability to enter another. A third hypothesis,
thevirus first hypothesis,suggests that viruses may have been the first self-replicating entities before the first cells. In all cases,
viruses are probably continuing to evolve along with the cells on which they rely on as hosts.
As technology advances, scientists may develop and refine additional hypotheses to explain the origins of viruses. The emerging
field called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material. These
researchers hope one day to better understand the origin of viruses—a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments
for the ailments they produce.
Viral Morphology
Viruses arenoncellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure. They therefore lack most of the
components of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane. A virion consists of a nucleic acid core, an outer
protein coating orcapsid, and sometimes an outerenvelopemade of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the
host cell. Viruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes, within the capsid or attached to the viral genome. The
most obvious difference between members of different viral families is the variation in their morphology, which is quite diverse.
An interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not necessarily correlate with the complexity of
the virion. In fact, some of the most complex virion structures are found in thebacteriophages—viruses that infect the simplest
living organisms, bacteria.
Morphology
Viruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these features are consistent for each viral family. As we have seen, all virions have a
nucleic acid genome covered by a protective capsid. The proteins of the capsid are encoded in the viral genome, and are called
capsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple helices or polyhedral “spheres,” whereas others are quite complex in structure
(Figure 21.3).

work by NIAID, NIH)
One of the most complex virions known, the T4 bacteriophage (which infects theEscherichia coli) bacterium, has a tail structure
that the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its DNA.
Adenovirus, a non-enveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses glycoprotein spikes protruding
from its capsomeres to attach to host cells. Non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts
(papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus).
Enveloped virions, such as the influenza virus, consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of influenza) and capsid proteins
surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope that contains virus-encoded proteins. Glycoproteins embedded in the viral
envelope are used to attach to host cells. Other envelope proteins are thematrix proteinsthat stabilize the envelope and often
play a role in the assembly of progeny virions. Chicken pox, HIV, and mumps are other examples of diseases caused by viruses
with envelopes. Because of the fragility of the envelope, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature,
pH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.
Overall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease the virus may cause or
what species it might infect, but they are still useful means to begin viral classification (Figure 21.5).

RNA viruses contain only RNA as their genetic material. To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the RNA viruses must
encode their own enzymes that can replicate RNA into RNA or, in the retroviruses, into DNA. TheseRNA polymerase enzymes
are more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription. For this
reason, mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This causes them to change and adapt more
rapidly to their host. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include influenza, hepatitis C, measles, and rabies. The HIV virus,
which is sexually transmitted, is an RNA retrovirus.
The Challenge of Virus Classification
Because most viruses probably evolved from different ancestors, the systematic methods that scientists have used to classify
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are not very useful. If viruses represent “remnants” of different organisms, then even genomic
or protein analysis is not useful. Why?,Because viruses have no common genomic sequence that they all share. For example, the
16S rRNA sequence so useful for constructing prokaryote phylogenies is of no use for a creature with no ribosomes! Biologists
have used several classification systems in the past. Viruses were initially grouped by shared morphology. Later, groups of
viruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or
double-stranded. However, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, because they were based on
different sets of characters of the virus. The most commonly used classification method today is called the Baltimore
classification scheme, and is based on how messenger RNA (mRNA) is generated in each particular type of virus.
Past Systems of Classification
Viruses contain only a few elements by which they can be classified: the viral genome, the type of capsid, and the envelope
structure for the enveloped viruses. All of these elements have been used in the past for viral classification (Table 21.1andFigure
21.6). Viral genomes may vary in the type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its organization (single- or double-stranded,
linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented). In some viruses, additional proteins needed for replication are associated
directly with the genome or contained within the viral capsid.

Baltimore Classification
The most commonly and currently used system of virus classification was first developed by Nobel Prize-winning biologist
David Baltimore in the early 1970s. In addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned above, the Baltimore
classification scheme groups viruses according to how the mRNA is produced during the replicative cycle of the virus.
Group Iviruses contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genome. Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the
same way as with cellular DNA, using the enzymes of the host cell.
Group IIviruses have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as their genome. They convert their single-stranded genomes into a dsDNA
intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur.
Group IIIviruses use dsRNA as their genome. The strands separate, and one of them is used as a template for the generation of
mRNA using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus.
Group IVviruses have ssRNA as their genome with apositive polarity, which means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as
mRNA. Intermediates of dsRNA, calledreplicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA.
Multiple, full-length RNA strands ofnegative polarity(complementary to the positive-stranded genomic RNA) are formed from
these intermediates, which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity, including both full-
length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs.

## Section 360.2
• Virus Infections and Hosts 515
Viruses are obligate, intracellular parasites. A virus must first recognize and attach to a specific living cell prior to entering it.
After penetration, the invading virus must copy its genome and manufacture its own proteins. Finally, the progeny virions must
escape the host cell so that they can infect other cells. Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within
that host. Specific host cells that a virus must occupy and use to replicate are calledpermissive. In most cases, the molecular
basis for this specificity is due to a particular surface molecule known as theviral receptoron the host cell surface. A specific
viral receptor is required for the virus to attach. In addition, differences in metabolism and host-cell immune responses (based
on differential gene expression) are a likely factor in determining which cells a virus may target for replication.
Steps of Virus Infections
A virus must use its host-cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural
changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, calledcytopathic effects, can change cell functions or
even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through
lysis(bursting) orapoptosis(programmed cell death or “cell suicide”), releasing all progeny virions at once. The symptoms of
viral diseases result both from such cell damage caused by the virus and from the immune response to the virus, which attempts
to control and eliminate the virus from the body.
Many animal viruses, such asHIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process
known asbudding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is
not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function
normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the
virus replication cycle:attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release(Figure 21.8).
Attachment
A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via
glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host—and the cells within the
host—that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each
key will fit only one specific lock.
LINK TO LEARNING
Thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/influenza)explains how influenza attacks the body.
Entry
Viruses may enter a host cell either with or without the viral capsid. The nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell
“naked,” leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses can enter throughendocytosis(as you may recall, the cell
membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus). Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly
with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid degrades, and then the viral nucleic acid is released and becomes
available for replication and transcription.
Replication and Assembly
The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host-cell proteins and enzymes to replicate
the viral DNA and to transcribe viral mRNA, which is then used to direct viral protein synthesis. RNA viruses usually use the
RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral
enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions.
Of course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral
genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses, such as HIV (group VI of the Baltimore
classification scheme), have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA, which then is incorporated into the
host cell genome. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse
transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells—the
enzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that HIV
produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes
without affecting the host’s metabolism.
This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number
of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many HIV-infected individuals.

Bacteriophages
Figure21.9Bacteriophages attached to a host cell (transmission electron micrograph). In bacteriophage with tails, like the one shown
here, the tails serve as a passageway for transmission of the phage genome. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Graham Beards; scale-bar
data from Matt Russell)
Most bacteriophages are dsDNA viruses, which use host enzymes for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Phage particles
must bind to specific surface receptors and actively insert the genome into the host cell. (The complex tail structures seen in
many bacteriophages are actively involved in getting the viral genome across the prokaryotic cell wall.) When infection of a cell
by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to beproductive. If the virions are released by
bursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of alytic cycle(Figure 21.10). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which
infectsEscherichia colifound in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without
being released. For example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of alysogenic cycle
(Figure 21.10), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into
the host-cell genome, it is called aprophage. An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the λ (lambda) virus, which also infects
theE.colibacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may sometimes undergo infections where they are not producing
virions for long periods. An example is the animalherpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of oral and genital
herpes in humans. In a process calledlatency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without
producing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though
there are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages.
Latency will be described in more detail in the next section.

Plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply. They are responsible
for poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. Others viruses may damage
plants used in landscaping. Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as
tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for landscaping, two of the
most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail,
but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants. In the

Animal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell. The
virus may even induce the host cell to cooperate in the infection process. Non-enveloped or “naked” animal viruses may enter
cells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the
cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process ofreceptor-mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used
by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the
host cell membrane. The viral genome is then “injected” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that
used by many bacteriophages.
Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or
fusion. Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to that seen in some non-
enveloped viruses. On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among
others, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus
releasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.
After making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell.
As we have already discussed using the example the influenza virus, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane
as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell’s plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped
viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are
released together.
As you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow the
classic pattern ofacute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the
virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral diseases are the
common cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-termchronic infections, such as the virus causing hepatitis C, whereas
others, like herpes simplex virus, only causeintermittentsymptoms. Still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7,
which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without
causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have anasymptomatic infection.
In hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is so low

Viruses cause a variety of diseases in animals, including humans, ranging from the common cold to potentially fatal illnesses
like meningitis (Figure 21.13). These diseases can be treated by antiviral drugs or by vaccines; however, some viruses, such as
HIV, are capable both of avoiding the immune response and of mutating within the host organism to become resistant to
antiviral drugs.

Spanish influenza virus so they can understand more about virology.
Vaccines and Antiviral Drugs for Treatment
In some cases, vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection. The concept behind this is that by giving the vaccine,
immunity is boosted without adding more disease-causing virus. In the case ofrabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted
via the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it
enters the central nervous system may be two weeks or longer. This is enough time to vaccinate individuals who suspect that
they have been bitten by a rabid animal, and their boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the virus from entering
nervous tissue. Thus, the potentially fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted, and the individual only has to
recover from the infected bite. This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly
viruses on Earth. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 70 to 90 percent of infected humans within
two weeks. Using newly developed vaccines thatboost the immune responsein this way, there is hope that affected individuals
will be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected persons from a rapid and very painful
death.
Another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. Because viruses use the resources of the host cell for
replication and the production of new virus proteins, it is difficult to block their activities without damaging the host. However,
we do have some effective antiviral drugs, such as those used to treat HIV and influenza. Some antiviral drugs are specific for a
particular virus and others have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For most viruses,
these drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins.It is important to note that the targeted
proteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell.In this way, viral growth is
inhibited without damaging the host.
Antivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex II) and influenza. For genital herpes, drugs such as
acyclovir can reduce the number and duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in
their skin cells. As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the
symptoms of the disease more manageable. For influenza, drugs like Tamiflu (oseltamivir) (Figure 21.15) can reduce the duration
of “flu” symptoms by one or two days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Tamiflu works by inhibiting an enzyme
(viral neuraminidase) that allows new virions to leave their infected cells. Thus, Tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from

membrane. Viral contents are released into the cell, where viral enzymes convert the single-stranded RNA genome into DNA and
incorporate it into the host genome. (credit: NIAID, NIH)
Unfortunately, when any of these drugs are used individually, the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily and rapidly
develop resistance to the drug, limiting the drug’s effectiveness. The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development
of HAART,highly active anti-retroviral therapy, which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug “cocktail.”
By attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle, it is much more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to
multiple drugs at the same time. Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that, over time, the
virus will develop resistance to this therapy. Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of
continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.

Other Acellular Entities: Prions and Viroids
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe prions and their basic properties
• Define viroids and their targets of infection
Prions and viroids arepathogens(agents with the ability to cause disease) that have simpler structures than viruses but, in the
case of prions, still can produce deadly diseases.
Prions
Prions, so-called because they are proteinaceous, are infectious particles—smaller than viruses—that contain no nucleic acids
(neither DNA nor RNA). Historically, the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible,
but pioneering work by Nobel Prize-winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents
do indeed exist.
Fatal neurodegenerative diseases, such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (commonly
known as “mad cow disease”) were shown to be transmitted by prions. The disease was spread by the consumption of meat,
nervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species. Kuru, native to humans in Papua New Guinea, was
spread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism. BSE, originally detected in the United Kingdom, was spread between
cattle by the practice of including cattle nervous tissue in feed for other cattle. Individuals with kuru and BSE show symptoms of

loss of motor control and unusual behaviors, such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter with kuru, followed by death. Kuru was
controlled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism.
On the other hand, BSE was initially thought to only affect cattle. Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed
lesions or “holes” in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge. Later on in the outbreak, however, it was shown
that a similar encephalopathy in humans, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), could be acquired from eating beef
from animals infected with BSE, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of British beef and causing considerable
economic damage to the British beef industry (Figure 21.17). BSE still exists in various areas, and although a rare disease,
individuals that acquire CJD are difficult to treat. The disease can be spread from human to human by blood, so many countries
have banned blood donation from regions associated with BSE.
The cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and BSE, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular protein
called PrP (prion protein). It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle. PrP exists in two forms,PrPc, the normal form of
the protein, andPrPsc, the infectious form. Once introduced into the body, the PrPsccontained within the prion binds to PrPc
and converts it to PrPsc. This leads to an exponential increase of the PrPscprotein, which aggregates. PrPscis folded abnormally,
and the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains of infected cattle. Thus, although
not without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new form of infectious agent, the first one
found whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA.
Figure21.17Mad Cow Disease in humans. (a) Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc)
when it encounters this variant form of the protein. PrPscmay arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form of the protein
is present, or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in food into brain tissue. (b) This prion-infected brain tissue,
visualized using light microscopy, shows the vacuoles that give it a spongy texture, typical of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

Viroids
Viroidsare plant pathogens: small, single-stranded, circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus. They do not have
a capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell. Viroids do not, however, manufacture any
proteins, and they only produce a single, specific RNA molecule. Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified.
Viroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.18) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars in
agricultural revenue each year. Some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums,
avocados, and coconut palms.

Prokaryotic Diversity
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the evolutionary history of prokaryotes
• Discuss the distinguishing features of extremophiles
• Explain why it is difficult to culture prokaryotes
Prokaryotes are ubiquitous. They cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture, and they
also live on and inside virtually all other living things. In the typical human body, prokaryotic cells
outnumber human body cells by about ten to one. They comprise the majority of living things in all
ecosystems. Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things.
Prokaryotes recyclenutrients—essential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)—and they drive the
evolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural and others man-made. Prokaryotes have been on
Earth since long before multicellular life appeared. Indeed, eukaryotic cells are thought to be the
descendants of ancient prokaryotic communities.
Prokaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth
When and where did cellular life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? We now know
that prokaryotes were likely the first forms of cellular life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years
before plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are dated at about 4.54billion years in age. This
estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate
material from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular
oxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong solar radiation; thus, the first organisms probably
would have flourished where they were more protected, such as in the deep ocean or far beneath the surface
of the Earth. Strong volcanic activity was common on Earth at this time, so it is likely that these first
organisms—the first prokaryotes—were adapted to very high temperatures. Because early Earth was prone
to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from
the sun, the first organisms were prokaryotes that must have withstood these harsh conditions.
Microbial Mats
Microbial matsor large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of prokaryotic life on Earth; there is fossil
evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago. It is remarkable that cellular life appeared on
Earth only a billion years after the Earth itself formed, suggesting that pre-cellular “life” that could replicate
itself had evolved much earlier. Amicrobial matis a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that
includes mostly bacteria, but also archaeans. Microbial mats are only a few centimeters thick, and they
typically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. The various types of
prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their
various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they
secrete calledextracellular matrix.
The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A
hydrothermal ventis a breakage or fissure in the Earth’s surface that releases geothermally heated water.
With the evolution of photosynthesis about three billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats
came to use a more widely available energy source—sunlight—whereas others were still dependent on
chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.

Stromatolites
Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth. Astromatoliteis a sedimentary structure formed when
minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat (Figure 22.3). Stromatolites form layered rocks made of
carbonate or silicate. Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where stromatolites are
still forming. For example, growing stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County,
California.

Glacier National Park, Montana, are nearly 1.5 billion years old. (credit a: Robert Young; credit b: P. Carrara, NPS)
The Ancient Atmosphere
Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth’s existence, the atmosphere wasanoxic, meaning that there
was no molecular oxygen. Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen—anaerobic organisms—were able to
live. Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are calledphototrophs, and they appeared within
one billion years of the formation of Earth. Then,cyanobacteria, also known as “blue-green algae,” evolved from these simple
phototrophs at least one billion years later. It was the ancestral cyanobacteria (Figure 22.4) that began the “oxygenation” of the
atmosphere: Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the evolution of more efficient O -utilizing catabolic pathways. It also

Prokaryotes in the Dead Sea
One example of a very harsh environment is the Dead Sea, a hypersaline basin that is located between Jordan and Israel.
Hypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater. In the Dead Sea, the sodium concentration is 10 times higher
than that of seawater, and the water contains high levels of magnesium (about 40 times higher than in seawater) that would be
toxic to most living things. Iron, calcium, and magnesium, elements that form divalent ions (Fe2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), produce
what is commonly referred to as “hard” water. Taken together, the high concentration of divalent cations, the acidic pH (6.0),
and the intense solar radiation flux make the Dead Sea a unique, and uniquely hostile, ecosystem1(Figure 22.6).
What sort of prokaryotes do we find in the Dead Sea? The extremely salt-tolerant bacterial mats includeHalobacterium,

prokaryote can go back to “normal” life when environmental conditions improve.
Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters
are non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under
laboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?
Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of
prokaryotes, e.g., 16S rRNA genes, demonstrating their existence. (Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment
in a process called amplification.)
The Ecology of Biofilms
Some prokaryotes may be unculturable because they require the presence of other prokaryotic species. Until a couple of decades
ago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart. This model, however, does not reflect the true
ecology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact. As we have seen, abiofilmis a
microbial community (Figure 22.8) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides
secreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. Biofilms typically grow attached to surfaces. Some of
the best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described, as well as some
composed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria.
Biofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial settings.
In recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role. They also colonize
household surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human body, such as the
surfaces of our teeth.
Interactions among the organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protectiveexopolysaccharidic (EPS)
environment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. The sticky substance that holds
bacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their planktonic
counterparts. Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of sterilization.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure22.8Development of a biofilm. Five stages of biofilm development are shown. During stage 1, initial attachment, bacteria adhere to
a solid surface via weakvan der Waals interactions(forces produced by induced electrical interactions between atoms). During stage 2,
irreversible attachment, hairlike appendages calledpilipermanently anchor the bacteria to the surface. During stage 3, maturation I, the
biofilm grows through cell division and recruitment of other bacteria. An extracellular matrix composed primarily of polysaccharides holds
the biofilm together. During stage 4, maturation II, the biofilm continues to grow and takes on a more complex shape. During stage 5,
dispersal, the biofilm matrix is partly broken down, allowing some bacteria to escape and colonize another surface. Micrographs of a
Pseudomonas aeruginosabiofilm in each of the stages of development are shown. (credit: D. Davis, Don Monroe, PLoS)
Compared to free-floating bacteria, bacteria in biofilms often show increased resistance to antibiotics and detergents. Why do
you think this might be the case?

Structure of Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the basic structure of a typical prokaryote
• Describe important differences in structure between Archaea and Bacteria
There are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The name "prokaryote" suggests that prokaryotes are
defined by exclusion—they are not eukaryotes, or organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other internal membrane-bound
organelles. However, all cells have four common structures: the plasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and
separates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a complex solution of organic molecules and salts inside the cell; a
double-stranded DNA genome, the informational archive of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place.
Prokaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories:cocci(spherical),bacilli(rod-shaped), andspirilli
(spiral-shaped) (Figure 22.9).
Figure22.9Common prokaryotic cell types. Prokaryotes fall into three basic categories based on their shape, visualized here using
scanning electron microscopy: (a) cocci, or spherical (a pair is shown); (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilli, or spiral-shaped. (credit a:

Matt Russell)
The Prokaryotic Cell
Recall that prokaryotes are unicellular organisms that lack membrane-bound organelles or other internal membrane-bound
structures (Figure 22.10). Their chromosome—usually single—consists of a piece of circular, double-stranded DNA located in an
area of the cell called thenucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane. Thecell wallfunctions as a
protective layer, and it is responsible for the organism’s shape. Some bacterial species have a capsule outside the cell wall. The
capsule enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells, and makes
pathogens more resistant to our immune responses. Some species also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion,
and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces including the surfaces of other cells. Plasmids, which consist of extra-
chromosomal DNA, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea.

Characteristics of bacterial phyla are described inFigure 22.12andFigure 22.13. Major bacterial phyla include the
Proteobacteria, the Chlamydias, the Spirochaetes, the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, and the Gram-positive bacteria. The
Proteobacteria are in turn subdivided into several classes, from the Alpha- to the Epsilon proteobacteria. Eukaryotic
mitochondria are thought to be the descendants of alphaproteobacteria, while eukaryotic chloroplasts are derived from
cyanobacteria. Archaeal phyla are described inFigure 22.14.

Figure22.15Bacterial and archaeal phospholipids. Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and Eukarya in two ways.
First, they have branched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones. Second, an ether bond instead of an ester bond connects the lipid to
the glycerol.
The Cell Wall of Prokaryotes
The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. Therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell
is relatively high. The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity. It is located
outside the cell membrane and preventsosmotic lysis(bursting due to increasing volume). The chemical composition of the cell
wall varies between Archaea and Bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species.
Bacterial cell walls containpeptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides
containing both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. (Proteins normally have only L-amino acids; as
a consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell-
wall development.) There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan.S-layer (surface layer) proteinsare also present on
the outside of cell walls of both Archaea and Bacteria.
Bacteria are divided into two major groups:Gram positiveandGram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining. Note
that all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias, Spirochetes,
Cyanobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative. The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish scientist Hans
Christian Gram (1853–1938). The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure.
Gram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms(Figure 22.16). Up to 90 percent
of the cell-wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances
calledteichoic acids. Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to formlipoteichoic acids.
Lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall composed of
a few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded by an outer envelope containing
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins. This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as a second lipid bilayer. The chemistry
of this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes.

Reproduction
Reproduction in prokaryotes isasexualand usually takes place by binary fission. (Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote is a single,
circular chromosome.) Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis; instead, the chromosome is replicated and the two resulting copies
separate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator and the
two resulting cells, which areclones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or
genetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms.
Intransformation, the prokaryote takes in DNA shed by other prokaryotes into its environment. If a nonpathogenic bacterium
takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome, it too may become
pathogenic. Intransduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, may move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from
one bacterium to another. Transduction results in arecombinant organism. Archaea also have viruses that may translocate
genetic material from one individual to another. Inconjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means
of apilus, which brings the organisms into contact with one another, and provides a channel for transfer of DNA. The DNA
transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a composite molecule, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA. These
three processes of DNA exchange are shown inFigure 22.17.
Reproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species. This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of genetic
recombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to
environmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly.

Prokaryotic Metabolism
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify the macronutrients needed by prokaryotes, and explain their importance
• Describe the ways in which prokaryotes get energy and carbon for life processes
• Describe the roles of prokaryotes in the carbon and nitrogen cycles
Prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms. In many cases, a prokaryote may be placed into a species clade by its defining
metabolic features: Can it metabolize lactose? Can it grow on citrate? Does it produce H S? Does it ferment carbohydrates to
2
produce acid and gas? Can it grow under anaerobic conditions? Since metabolism and metabolites are the product of enzyme
pathways, and enzymes are encoded in genes, the metabolic capabilities of a prokaryote are a reflection of its genome. There are
many different environments on Earth with various energy and carbon sources, and variable conditions to which prokaryotes
may be able to adapt. Prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment from deep-water volcanic vents to Antarctic ice by
using whatever energy and carbon sources are available. Prokaryotes fill many niches on Earth, including involvement in
nitrogen and carbon cycles, photosynthetic production of oxygen, decomposition of dead organisms, and thriving as parasitic,
commensal, or mutualistic organisms inside multicellular organisms, including humans. The very broad range of environments
that prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have diverse metabolic processes.
Needs of Prokaryotes
The diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients,
acidity, salinity, oxygen availability, and energy sources. Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast
array of nutrients and environmental conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some
additional nutrients.
Macronutrients
Cells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced by the
polymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain
substances, collectively callednutrients. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they must obtain their nutrients from the
environment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are calledmacronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or
trace amounts are calledmicronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronymCHONPS.)
Why are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including
water. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other
compounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. In contrast, nitrogen represents only 12
percent of the total dry weight of a typical cell. Nitrogen is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents.
Most of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N ) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N ) nitrogen,
2 2
however, can be converted into an organic form only by certain microorganisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both
hydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the
synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine,
and is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg),
calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the
structure and function of the prokaryotic cell.
Micronutrients
In addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred to as
micronutrients or trace elements. For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in electron-
transport reactions. Some prokaryotes require other elements—such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese
(Mn)—primarily as enzyme cofactors.
The Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy
Prokaryotes are classified both by the way they obtain energy, and by the carbon source they use for producing organic
molecules. These categories are summarized inTable 22.3. Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to generate the ATP
needed for biosynthesis and other cellular activities.Phototrophs(or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from
sunlight. Phototrophs trap the energy of light using chlorophylls, or in a few cases, bacterial rhodopsin. (Rhodopsin-using
phototrophs, oddly, are phototrophic, but not photosynthetic, since they do not fix carbon.)Chemotrophs(or chemosynthetic

scientific consensus suggests that metabolically interactive prokaryotic communities may have been the basis for the emergence
of eukaryotic cells.
Prokaryotes and the Carbon Cycle
Carbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (Figure 22.18).
The carbon cycle traces the movement of carbon from inorganic to organic compounds and back again. Carbon is cycled through
Earth’s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass. In a way, the carbon
cycle echoes the role of the “four elements” first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher, Empedocles: fire, water, earth, and
air. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere
via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon
reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available.
Participants in the carbon cycle are roughly divided among producers, consumers, and decomposers of organic carbon
compounds. Theprimary producersof organic carbon compounds from CO are land plants and photosynthetic bacteria. A
2
large amount of available carbon is found in living land plants. A related source of carbon compounds ishumus, which is a
mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. (The term "humus," by the
way, is the root of the word "human.") Consumers such as animals and other heterotrophs use organic compounds generated by
producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Other bacteria and fungi, collectively calleddecomposers, carry out
the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds. Most carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
derived from the respiration of microorganisms that decompose dead animals, plants, and humus.
In aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is based
on one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH ). This methane moves
4
into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria calledmethane oxidizersthat oxidize
methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.

Bacterial Diseases in Humans
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify bacterial diseases that caused historically important plagues and epidemics
• Describe the link between biofilms and foodborne diseases
• Explain how overuse of antibiotics may be creating “super bugs”
• Explain the importance of MRSA with respect to the problems of antibiotic resistance
To a prokaryote, humans may be just another housing opportunity. Unfortunately, the tenancy of some species can have harmful
effects and cause disease. Bacteria or other infectious agents that cause harm to their human hosts are calledpathogens.
Devastating pathogen-borne diseases and plagues, both viral and bacterial in nature, have affected humans and their ancestors
for millions of years. The true cause of these diseases was not understood until modern scientific thought developed, and many
people thought that diseases were a “spiritual punishment.” Only within the past several centuries have people understood that
staying away from afflicted persons, disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness, and sanitation
practices reduced their own chances of getting sick.
Epidemiologists study how diseases are transmitted and how they affect a population. Often, they must following the course of
anepidemic—a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time. In contrast, a
pandemicis a widespread, and usually worldwide, epidemic. Anendemic diseaseis a disease that is always present, usually at
low incidence, in a population.
Long History of Bacterial Disease
There are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 B.C. A number of significant pandemics caused by bacteria have
been documented over several hundred years. Some of the most memorable pandemics led to the decline of cities and entire
nations.
In the 21stcentury, infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical
research and treatments in recent decades. A diseasespreadswhen the pathogen that causes it is passed from one person to
another. For a pathogen to cause disease, it must be able to reproduce in the host’s body and damage the host in some way.
The Plague of Athens
In 430 B.C., the Plague of Athens killed one-quarter of the Athenian troops who were fighting in the great Peloponnesian War
and weakened Athens’s dominance and power. The plague impacted people living in overcrowded Athens as well as troops
aboard ships that had to return to Athens. The source of the plague may have been identified recently when researchers from the
University of Athens were able to use DNA from teeth recovered from a mass grave. The scientists identified nucleotide
sequences from a pathogenic bacterium,Salmonella entericaserovar Typhi (Figure 22.20), which causestyphoid fever.3This
disease is commonly seen in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded history.

during the 14thcentury.
Migration of Diseases to New Populations
One of the negative consequences of human exploration was the accidental “biological warfare” that resulted from the transport
of a pathogen into a population that had not previously been exposed to it. Over the centuries, Europeans tended to develop
genetic immunity to endemic infectious diseases, but when European conquerors reached the western hemisphere, they
brought with them disease-causing bacteria and viruses, which triggered epidemics that completely devastated many diverse
populations of Native Americans, who had no natural resistance to many European diseases. It has been estimated that up to 90
percent of Native Americans died from infectious diseases after the arrival of Europeans, making conquest of the New World a
foregone conclusion.
Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases
The distribution of a particular disease isdynamic. Changes in the environment, the pathogen, or the host population can
dramatically impact the spread of a disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemerging disease(Figure
22.22) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in
incidence or geographic range. This definition also includesre-emerging diseasesthat were previously under control.
Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases.Zoonosesare
diseases that primarily infect animals but can be transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial
origin. Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, andnecrotizing fasciitis
(commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons.

each year from foodborne illness.”
The characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time. In the past, it was relatively common to hear about sporadic
cases of botulism, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacteriumClostridium botulinum. Some
of the most common sources for this bacterium were non-acidic canned foods, homemade pickles, and processed meat and
sausages. The can, jar, or package created a suitable anaerobic environment whereClostridiumcould grow. Proper sterilization
and canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease.
While people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animal-based foods, most cases are now linked to
produce. There have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the United States and with
vegetable sprouts in Germany, and these types of outbreaks have become more common. The raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was
produced by the bacteriumE. coliserotype O157:H7. A serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of similar antigens on its
cell surface, and there are often many different serotypes of a bacterial species. MostE. coliare not particularly dangerous to
humans, but serotype O157:H7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal.
All types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria. Recent outbreaks ofSalmonellareported by the CDC occurred in
foods as diverse as peanut butter, alfalfa sprouts, and eggs. A deadly outbreak in Germany in 2010 was caused byE. coli
contamination of vegetable sprouts (Figure 22.24). The strain that caused the outbreak was found to be a new serotype not
previously involved in other outbreaks, which indicates thatE. coliis continuously evolving. Outbreaks of listeriosis, due to
contamination of meats, raw cheeses, and frozen or fresh vegetables withListeria monocytogenes, are becoming more
frequent.
Figure22.24Foodborne pathogens. (a) Vegetable sprouts grown at an organic farm were the cause of an (b)E. colioutbreak that killed 32
people and sickened 3,800 in Germany in 2011. The strain responsible,E. coliO104:H4, produces Shiga toxin, a substance that inhibits
protein synthesis in the host cell. The toxin (c) destroys red blood cells resulting in bloody diarrhea. Deformed red blood cells clog the
capillaries of the kidney, which can lead to kidney failure, as happened to 845 patients in the 2011 outbreak. Kidney failure is usually
reversible, but some patients experience kidney problems years later. (credit c: NIDDK, NIH)
Biofilms and Disease
Recall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy. They are responsible for diseases such as
Legionnaires’ disease, otitis media (ear infections), and various infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. They produce dental
plaque and colonize catheters, prostheses, transcutaneous and orthopedic devices, contact lenses, and internal devices such as
pacemakers. They also form in open wounds and burned tissue. In healthcare environments, biofilms grow on hemodialysis
machines, mechanical ventilators, shunts, and other medical equipment. In fact, 65 percent of all infections acquired in the
hospital (nosocomial infections) are attributed to biofilms. Biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because
they colonize the surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat, as well as food-processing equipment that isn’t adequately cleaned.
Biofilm infections develop gradually and may not cause immediate symptoms. They are rarely resolved by host defense
mechanisms. Once an infection by a biofilm is established, it is very difficult to eradicate, because biofilms tend to be resistant
to most methods used to control microbial growth, including antibiotics. The matrix that attaches the cells to a substrate and to
other another protects the cells from antibiotics or drugs. In addition, since biofilms grow slowly, they are less responsive to
agents that interfere with cell growth. It has been reported that biofilms can resist up to 1,000 times the antibiotic
concentrations used to kill the same bacteria when they are free-living or planktonic. An antibiotic dose that large would harm
the patient; therefore, scientists are working on new ways to get rid of biofilms.

In summary, the medical community is facing an antibiotic crisis. Some scientists believe that after years of being protected
from bacterial infections by antibiotics, we may be returning to a time in which a simple bacterial infection could again
devastate the human population. Researchers are developing new antibiotics, but it takes many years of research and clinical
trials, plus financial investments in the millions of dollars, to generate an effective and approved drug.
CAREER CONNECTION
Epidemiologist
Epidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and determinants of health and disease in a population. It is,
therefore, part of public health. An epidemiologist studies the frequency and distribution of diseases within human populations
and environments.
Epidemiologists collect data about a particular disease and track its spread to identify the original mode of transmission. They
sometimes work in close collaboration with historians to try to understand the way a disease evolved geographically and over
time, tracking the natural history of pathogens. They gather information from clinical records, patient interviews, surveillance,
and any other available means. That information is used to develop strategies, such as vaccinations (Figure 22.26), and design
public health policies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread. Epidemiologists also conduct rapid
investigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it.
An epidemiologist has a bachelor’s degree, plus a master’s degree in public health (MPH). Many epidemiologists are also
physicians (and have an M.D. or D.O degree), or they have a Ph.D. in an associated field, such as biology or microbiology.

• Explain the need for nitrogen fixation and how it is accomplished
• Describe the beneficial effects of bacteria that colonize our skin and digestive tracts
• Identify prokaryotes used during the processing of food
• Describe the use of prokaryotes in bioremediation
Fortunately, only a few species of prokaryotes are pathogenic! Prokaryotes also interact with humans and other organisms in a
number of ways that are beneficial. For example, prokaryotes are major participants in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. They
produce or process nutrients in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals. Prokaryotes are used in the production of
some human foods, and also have been recruited for the degradation of hazardous materials. In fact, our life would not be
possible without prokaryotes!
Cooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes: Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building
blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with
atmospheric nitrogen, N , providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric,
2
gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be “fixed,” meaning it is converted into a more
accessible form—ammonia (NH)—either biologically or abiotically.
3
Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of physical processes such as lightning or by industrial processes.Biological nitrogen
fixation(BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, andFrankiaspp. (filamentous bacteria
interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis, BNF is the most important
biological process on Earth. The overall nitrogen fixation equation below represents a series ofredox reactions(Pi stands for
inorganic phosphate).
The total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per year, which contributes about 65 percent of the
nitrogen used in agriculture.
Cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. In soil, members of the generaClostridiumand
Azotobacterare examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants,
providing the most important source of fixed nitrogen. Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by
a factor of 10. Soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to formnodules,
specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs (Figure 22.27).Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated
by oxygen, so the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. The oxygen is sequestered by a form of

plant hemoglobin calledleghemoglobin, which protects thenitrogenase, but releases enough oxygen to support respiratory
activity.
Symbiotic nitrogen fixationprovides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer: It reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia,
which is easily usable by plants. The use oflegumes is an excellent alternative tochemical fertilization and is of specialinterest
tosustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize theuse of chemicals and conserve natural resources. Through symbiotic
nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. The bacteria benefit from using
photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. In addition, the
soil benefits from being naturally fertilized. Therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.
Why are legumes so important? Some, like soybeans,are key sources of agricultural protein.Some of the most important
legumes consumed by humans are soybeans, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans. Other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to
feed cattle.

Everyday Connection
Microbes on the Human Body
The commensal bacteria that inhabit our skin and gastrointestinal tract do a host of good things for us. They protect us from
pathogens, help us digest our food, and produce some of our vitamins and other nutrients. These activities have been
known for a long time. More recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our
moods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns. The
Human Microbiome Project has begun the process of cataloging our normal bacteria (and archaea) so we can better
understand these functions.
A particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems. People who take high doses of
antibiotics tend to lose many of their normal gut bacteria, allowing a naturally antibiotic-resistant species called
Clostridium difficileto overgrow and cause severe gastric problems, especially chronic diarrhea (Figure 22.28). Obviously,
trying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse. However, it has been successfully treated by giving the
patients fecal transplants from healthy donors to reestablish the normal intestinal microbial community. Clinical trials are
underway to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this technique.

Cheese production began around 4,000 to 7,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk.
Fermentation in this case preserves nutrients: Milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more stable.
As for beer, the oldest records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and were an integral part of the Sumerian culture. Evidence
indicates that the Sumerians discovered fermentation by chance.Wine has been produced for about 4,500 years, and evidence
suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.
Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation
Microbialbioremediationis the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been
used to remove agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface.
Certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation.
The reduction of SeO -2to SeO-2and to Se0(metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury
4 3
(Hg) is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. As an active ingredient of
some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production. Methyl
mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in
living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These
bacteria, such asPseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg+2into Hg0, which is nontoxic to humans.
One of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil
spills. The significance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years,
such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (Figure 22.30), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the

This name was first suggested by Ernst Haeckel in the late nineteenth century. It has been applied in
many contexts and has been formally used to represent a kingdom-level taxon called Protista. However, 23.4 Ecology of Protists
many modern systematists (biologists who study the relationships among organisms) are beginning to
shy away from the idea of formal ranks such as kingdom and phylum. Instead, they are naming taxa as
groups of organisms thought to include all the descendants of a last common ancestor (monophyletic
group). During the past two decades, the field of molecular genetics has demonstrated that some
protists are more related to animals, plants, or fungi than they are to other protists. Therefore, not
including animals, plants, and fungi make the kingdom Protista a paraphyletic group, or one that does
not include all descendents of its common ancestor. For this reason, protist lineages originally classified
into the kingdom Protista continue to be examined and debated. In the meantime, the term “protist” still
is used informally to describe this tremendously diverse group of eukaryotes.
Most protists are microscopic, unicellular organisms that are abundant in soil, freshwater, brackish, and
marine environments. They are also common in the digestive tracts of animals and in the vascular
tissues of plants. Others invade the cells of other protists, animals, and plants. Not all protists are
microscopic. Some have huge, macroscopic cells, such as the plasmodia (giant amoebae) of myxomycete
slime molds or the marine green algaCaulerpa, which can have single cells that can be several meters in
size. Some protists are multicellular, such as the red, green, and brown seaweeds. It is among the
protists that one finds the wealth of ways that organisms can grow.

# Chapter 397

## Section 397.1
Eukaryotic Origins
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the unifying characteristics of eukaryotes
• Describe what scientists know about the origins of eukaryotes based on the last common
ancestor
• Explain the endosymbiotic theory
Organisms are classified into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The first two lineages
comprise all prokaryotic cells, and the third contains all eukaryotes. A very sparse fossil record prevents us
from determining what the first members of each of these lineages looked like, so it is possible that all the
events that led to the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes will remain unknown. However,
comparative biology of extant (living) organisms and the limited fossil record provide some insight into the
evolution of Eukarya.
The earliest fossils found appear to be those of domain Bacteria, most likely cyanobacteria. They are about

## Section 397.2
to 3.8 billion years old and are recognizable because of their relatively complex structure and, for
prokaryotes, relatively large cells. Most other prokaryotes have small cells, 1 or 2 µm in size, and would be
difficult to pick out as fossils. Fossil stromatolites suggest that at least some prokaryotes lived in interactive
communities, and evidence from the structure of living eukaryotic cells suggests that it was similar ancestral
interactions that gave rise to the eukaryotes. Most living eukaryotes have cells measuring 10 µm or greater.
Structures this size, which might be fossilized remains of early eukaryotes, appear in the geological record
in deposits dating to about 2.1 billion years ago.
Characteristics of Eukaryotes
Data from these fossils, as well as from the study of living genomes, have led comparative biologists to
conclude that living eukaryotes are all descendants of a single common ancestor. Mapping the
characteristics found in all major groups of eukaryotes reveals that the following characteristics are present
in at least some of the members of each major lineage, or during some part of their life cycle, and therefore
must have been present in thelast common ancestor.
1. Cells with nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope with nuclear pores: This is the single characteristic
that is both necessary and sufficient to define an organism as a eukaryote. All extant eukaryotes have
cells with nuclei.
2. Mitochondria: Most extant eukaryotes have "typical" mitochondria, although some eukaryotes have
very reduced mitochondrial “remnants” and a few lack detectable mitochondria.
3. Cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments: Eukaryotic cells possess the structural and motility
components calledactin microfilaments and microtubules. All extant eukaryotes have these
cytoskeletal elements.
4. Flagella and cilia: Organelles associated with cell motility. Some extant eukaryotes lack flagella and/or
cilia, but their presence in related lineages suggests that they are descended from ancestors that
possessed these organelles.
5. Chromosomes organized by histones: Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a linear DNA molecule
coiled around basic (alkaline) proteins called histones. The few eukaryotes with chromosomes lacking
histones clearly evolved from ancestors that had them.
6. Mitosis: A process of nuclear division in which replicated chromosomes are divided and separated
using elements of the cytoskeleton. Mitosis is universally present in eukaryotes.
7. Sexual reproduction: A meiotic process of nuclear division and genetic recombination unique to
eukaryotes. During this process, diploid nuclei at one stage of the life cycle undergo meiosis to yield
haploid nuclei, which subsequently fuse together (karyogamy) to create a diploid zygote nucleus.
8. Cell walls: It might be reasonable to conclude that the last common ancestor could make cell walls
during some stage of its life cycle, simple because cell walls were present in their prokaryote precursors.
However, not enough is known about eukaryotes’ cell walls and their development to know how much
homology exists between those of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. If the last common ancestor could make
cell walls, it is clear that this ability must have been lost in many groups.

## Section 397.3
• Eukaryotic Origins 575
Endosymbiosis and the Evolution of Eukaryotes
Before we discuss the origins of eukaryotes, it is first important to understand that all extant eukaryotes are likely the
descendants of a chimera-like organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s) of an alpha-proteobacterium that
“took up residence” inside it. This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known asendosymbiosis, one cell engulfing
another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit. Over many generations, a symbiotic relationship can result in
two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own. Endosymbiotic events likely
contributed to the origin of the last common ancestor of today’s eukaryotes and to later diversification in certain lineages of
eukaryotes (Figure 23.5). Similar endosymbiotic associations are not uncommon in living eukaryotes. Before explaining this
further, it is necessary to consider metabolism in prokaryotes.
Prokaryotic Metabolism
Many important metabolic processes arose in prokaryotes; however, some of these processes, such as nitrogen fixation, are
never found in eukaryotes. The process of aerobic respiration is found in all major lineages of eukaryotes, and it is localized in
the mitochondria. Aerobic respiration is also found in many lineages of prokaryotes, but it is not present in all of them, and a
great deal of evidence suggests that such anaerobic prokaryotes never carried out aerobic respiration nor did their ancestors.
While today’s atmosphere is about 20 percent molecular oxygen (O ), geological evidence shows that it originally lacked O .
2 2
Without oxygen, aerobic respiration would not be expected, and living things would have relied on anaerobic respiration or the
process of fermentation instead. At some point before about 3.8 billion years ago, some prokaryotes began using energy from
sunlight to power anabolic processes that reduce carbon dioxide to form organic compounds. That is, they evolved the ability to
photosynthesize. Hydrogen, derived from various sources, was “captured” using light-powered reactions to reduce fixed carbon
dioxide in the Calvin cycle. The group of Gram-negative bacteria that gave rise to cyanobacteria used water as the hydrogen
source and released O as a “waste” product.
2
Eventually, the amount of photosynthetic oxygen built up in some environments to levels that posed a risk to living organisms,
since it can damage many organic compounds. Various metabolic processes evolved that protected organisms from oxygen, one
of which, aerobic respiration, also generated high levels of ATP. It became widely present among prokaryotes, including in a
free-living group we now call alpha-proteobacteria. Organisms that did not acquire aerobic respiration had to remain in
oxygen-free environments. Originally, oxygen-rich environments were likely localized around places where cyanobacteria were
abundant and active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher
concentrations in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels similar to today’s levels only arose within the last 700 million years.
Recall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they seemed to have evolved and
diversified rapidly as oxygen levels were increasing. Also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with
mitochondria. These organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be
somewhat worm-shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell. Some early observers suggested that they
might be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities.
Endosymbiotic Theory
As cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for
producing ATP using aerobic respiration, in which oxygen was the final electron acceptor. In the 1960s, American biologist Lynn
Margulis of Boston University developed theendosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of
one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer
recognizable as such and shared genetic control of a mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce ATP. In 1967, Margulis
introduced new data to support her work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence.
Although Margulis’s work initially was met with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now
widely accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players
involved.
While the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy-harvesting processes appear to have had their origins in
bacteria, our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear to be more closely
related to those found in the Archaea. Much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred; this continues to be an
exciting field of discovery in biology. For instance, it isnotknown whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria
occurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus. Such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common
ancestor of eukaryotes.

# Chapter 398

## Section 398.1
• Eukaryotic Origins 577
some of these eukaryotes were descended from ancestors whose lineages had diverged from the lineage of mitochondrion-
containing eukaryotes before endosymbiosis occurred. Later findings suggest thatreduced organellesare found in most, if not
all, anaerobic eukaryotes, and that virtually all eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial
origin.
In addition to the aerobic generation of ATP, mitochondria have several other metabolic functions. One of these functions is to
generate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes. Such functions are often associated with the
reduced mitochondrion-derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes. The protistMonocercomonoides,an inhabitant of
vertebrate digestive tracts, appears to be an exception; it has no mitochondria and its genome contains neither genes derived
from mitochondria nor nuclear genes related to mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is related to other protists with
reduced mitochondria and probably represents an end-point in mitochondrial reduction. Although most biologists accept that
the last common ancestor of eukaryotes had mitochondria, it appears that the complex relationship between mitochondria and
their host cell continues to evolve.
Plastids
Some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic. Their cells contain, in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles, another
kind of organelle called aplastid. When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis, their plastids are rich in the pigment
chlorophyllaand a range of other pigments, calledaccessory pigments, which are involved in harvesting energy from light.
Photosynthetic plastids are called chloroplasts (Figure 23.3).
Figure23.3Chloroplasts. (a) This chloroplast cross-section illustrates its elaborate inner membrane organization. Stacks of thylakoid
membranes compartmentalize photosynthetic enzymes and provide scaffolding for chloroplast DNA. (b) In this micrograph ofElodeasp.,
the chloroplasts can be seen as small green spheres. (credit b: modification of work by Brandon Zierer; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Like mitochondria, plastids appear to have an endosymbiotic origin. This hypothesis was also proposed and championed with
the first direct evidence by Lynn Margulis. We now know that plastids are derived from cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells
of an ancestral, aerobic, heterotrophic eukaryote. This is called primary endosymbiosis, and plastids of primary origin are
surrounded by two membranes. However, the best evidence is that the acquisition of cyanobacterial endosymbionts has
happenedtwicein the history of eukaryotes. In one case, the common ancestor of the major lineage/supergroup Archaeplastida
took on a cyanobacterial endosymbiont; in the other, the ancestor of the small amoeboid rhizarian taxon,Paulinella, took on a
different cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes are descended from the first event, and only a
couple of species are derived from the other, which in evolutionary terms, appears to be more recent.
Cyanobacteria are a group of Gram-negative bacteria with all the conventional structures of the group. However, unlike most
prokaryotes, they have extensive, internal membrane-bound sacs called thylakoids. Chlorophyll is a component of these
membranes, as are many of the proteins of the light reactions of photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria also have the peptidoglycan wall
and lipopolysaccharide layer associated with Gram-negative bacteria.
Chloroplasts of primary endosymbiotic origin have thylakoids, a circular DNA chromosome, and ribosomes similar to those of
cyanobacteria. As in mitochondria, each chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes. The outer membrane is thought to be
derived from the enclosing vacuole of the host, and the inner membrane is thought to be derived from the plasma membrane of
the cyanobacterial endosymbiont. In the group of Archaeplastida called the glaucophytes and in the rhizarianPaulinella, a thin
peptidoglycan layer is still present between the outer and inner plastid membranes. All other plastids lack this relict of the

membrane proliferation, compartmentalization of cellular function (into a nucleus, lysosomes, and an endoplasmic reticulum), and the
establishment of endosymbiotic relationships with an aerobic prokaryote, and, in some cases, a photosynthetic prokaryote, to form
mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively.
What evidence is there that mitochondria were incorporated into the ancestral eukaryotic cell before chloroplasts?
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Secondary Endosymbiosis in Chlorarachniophytes
Endosymbiosis involves one cell engulfing another to produce, over time, a coevolved relationship in which neither cell could
survive alone. The chloroplasts of red and green algae, for instance, are derived from the engulfment of a photosynthetic
cyanobacterium by an ancestral prokaryote.
This evidence suggests the possibility that an ancestral cell (already containing a photosynthetic endosymbiont) was engulfed by
another eukaryote cell, resulting in a secondary endosymbiosis. Molecular and morphological evidence suggest that the
chlorarachniophyte protistsare derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event. Chlorarachniophytes are rare algae indigenous
to tropical seas and sand. They are classified into the Rhizarian supergroup. Chlorarachniophytes are reticulose amoebae,
extending thin cytoplasmic strands that interconnect them with other chlorarachniophytes in a cytoplasmic network. These
protists are thought to have originated when a eukaryote engulfed a green alga, the latter of which had previously established an
endosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (Figure 23.6).

Characteristics of Protists
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the cell structure characteristics of protists
• Describe the metabolic diversity of protists
• Describe the life cycle diversity of protists
There are over 100,000 described living species of protists, and it is unclear how many undescribed species may exist. Since
many protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often species-specific, there is a
huge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of their hosts. Because the name "protist" serves as a catchall term
for eukaryotic organisms that are not animal, plant, or fungi, it is not surprising that very few characteristics are common to all
protists. On the other hand, familiar characteristics of plants and animals are foreshadowed in various protists.
Cell Structure
The cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. Multicellular plants, animals, and fungi are embedded among the
protists in eukaryotic phylogeny. In most plants and animals and some fungi, complexity arises out ofmulticellularity,tissue
specialization,and subsequent interaction because of these features. Although a rudimentary form of multicellularity exists
among some of the organisms labelled as “protists,” those that have remained unicellular show how complexity can evolve in the
absence of true multicellularity, with the differentiation of cellular morphology and function. A few protists live as colonies that
behave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism. Some protists are composed of
enormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime, or in other cases, like ferns. In some species of

protists, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function.
Single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares! Protist cells may be enveloped
by animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound withpelliclesof
interlocking protein strips. The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced
without compromising its range of motion.
Metabolism
Protists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic. Those that store energy by photosynthesis belong to a
group ofphotoautotrophsand are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts. Other protists areheterotrophicand consume
organic materials (such as other organisms) to obtain nutrition. Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest
particles by a process calledphagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off
an intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole (Figure 23.7). In some protists, food vacuoles can be formed
anywhere on the body surface, whereas in others, they may be restricted to the base of a specialized feeding structure. The
vesicle containing the ingested particle, the phagosome, then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a
phagolysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in
cellular metabolism. Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell viaexocytosis.
Figure23.7Phagocytosis. The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle, the digestion of the particle using
hydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome, and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell.
Subtypes of heterotrophs, called saprobes, absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes. Some protists can
function asmixotrophs, obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes, depending on whether sunlight or
organic nutrients are available.
Motility
The majority of protists are motile, but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement (Figure 23.8). Some
protists have one or more flagella, which they rotate or whip. Others are covered in rows or tufts of tiny cilia that they beat in a
coordinated manner to swim. Still others form cytoplasmic extensions calledpseudopodiaanywhere on the cell, anchor the
pseudopodia to a substrate, and pull themselves forward. Some protists can move toward or away from a stimulus, a movement
referred to as taxis. For example, movement toward light, termed phototaxis, is accomplished by coupling their locomotion
strategy with a light-sensing organ.

recent common ancestry. This phenomenon, called convergent evolution, is one reason why protist classification is so
challenging. The emerging classification scheme groups the entire domain Eukarya into six “supergroups” that contain all of the
protists as well as animals, plants, and fungi that evolved from a common ancestor (Figure 23.9). Each of the supergroups is
believed to be monophyletic, meaning that all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single
common ancestor, and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside that group. There is
still evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups. Each supergroup can be viewed as representing one of many variants
on eukaryotic cell structure. In each group, one or more of the defining characters of the eukaryotic cell—the nucleus, the
cytoskeleton, and the endosymbiotic organelles—may have diverged from the "typical" pattern.

divided into six supergroups. Within each supergroup are multiple kingdoms. Although each supergroup is believed to be monophyletic, the

parasites. Both the red algae and the glaucophytes store carbohydrates in the cytoplasm rather than in the plastid. Red algae are
common in tropical waters where they have been detected at depths of 260 meters. Other red algae exist in terrestrial or
freshwater environments. The red algae life cycle is an unusual alternation of generations that includes two sporophyte phases,
with meiosis occurring only in the second sporophyte.
Green Algae: Chlorophytes and Charophytes
The most abundant group of algae is the green algae. The green algae exhibit features similar to those of the land plants,
particularly in terms of chloroplast structure. In both green algae and plants, carbohydrates are stored in the plastid. That this
group of protists shared a relatively recent common ancestor with land plants is well supported. The green algae are subdivided
into the chlorophytes and the charophytes. The charophytes are the closest living relatives to land plants and resemble them in
morphology and reproductive strategies. The familiarSpirogyrais a charophyte. Charophytes are common in wet habitats, and

secretion. Individual cells in aVolvoxcolony move in a coordinated fashion and are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges. Only
a few of the cells reproduce to create daughter colonies, an example of basic cell specialization in this organism. Daughter
colonies are produced with their flagella on the inside and have to evert as they are released.

True multicellular organisms, such as the sea lettuce,Ulva, are also represented among the chlorophytes. In addition, some
chlorophytes exist as large, multinucleate, single cells. Species in the genusCaulerpaexhibit flattened fern-like foliage and can
reach lengths of 3 meters (Figure 23.12).Caulerpaspecies undergo nuclear division, but their cells do not complete cytokinesis,
remaining instead as massive and elaborate single cells.

Slime Molds
A subset of the amoebozoans, the slime molds, has several morphological similarities to fungi that are thought to be the result of
convergent evolution. For instance, during times of stress, some slime molds develop into spore-generating fruiting bodies,
much like fungi.
The slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types. Plasmodial slime molds are
composed of large, multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of slime during their feeding stage
(Figure 23.14). Food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it glides along. The "dog vomit" slime mold seen in
Figure 23.14is a particularly colorful specimen and its ability to creep about might well trigger suspicion of alien invasion. Upon
maturation, the plasmodium takes on a net-like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies, or sporangia, during times
of stress. Haploid spores are produced by meiosis within the sporangia, and spores can be disseminated through the air or
water to potentially land in more favorable environments. If this occurs, the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate
haploid cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle.
Figure23.14Plasmodial slime molds. The life cycle of the plasmodial slime mold is shown. The brightly colored plasmodium in the inset
photo is a single-celled, multinucleate mass. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Jonatha Gott and the Center for RNA Molecular Biology,
Case Western Reserve University)
The cellular slime molds function as independent amoeboid cells when nutrients are abundant. When food is depleted, cellular
slime molds aggregate into a mass of cells that behaves as a single unit, called a slug. Some cells in the slug contribute to a
2–3-millimeter stalk, drying up and dying in the process. Cells atop the stalk form an asexual fruiting body that contains
haploid spores (Figure 23.15). As with plasmodial slime molds, the spores are disseminated and can germinate if they land in a
moist environment. One representative genus of the cellular slime molds isDictyostelium, which commonly exists in the damp

The previous supergroups are all the products of primary endosymbiontic events and their organelles—nucleus, mitochondria,
and chloroplasts—are what would be considered "typical," i.e., matching the diagrams you would find in an introductory biology
book. The next three supergroups all contain at least some photosynthetic members whose chloroplasts were derived by
secondary endosymbiosis. They also show some interesting variations in nuclear structure, and modification of mitochondria or
chloroplasts.
Rhizaria
The Rhizaria supergroup includes many of the amoebas with thin threadlike, needle-like or root-like pseudopodia (Figure 23.17),
rather than the broader lobed pseudopodia of the Amoebozoa. Many rhizarians make elaborate and beautiful tests—armor-like
coverings for the body of the cell—composed of calcium carbonate, silicon, or strontium salts. Rhizarians have important roles
in both carbon and nitrogen cycles. When rhizarians die, and their tests sink into deep water, the carbonates are out of reach of
most decomposers, locking carbon dioxide away from the atmosphere. In general, this process by which carbon is transported
deep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon pump, because carbon is “pumped” to the ocean depths where it is
inaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that
maintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Foraminiferans are unusual in that they are the only eukaryotes known to
participate in the nitrogen cycle by denitrification, an activity usually served only by prokaryotes.

Chromalveolata
Current evidence suggests that species classified as chromalveolates are derived from a common ancestor that engulfed a
photosynthetic red algal cell, which itself had already evolved chloroplasts from an endosymbiotic relationship with a
photosynthetic prokaryote. Therefore, the ancestor of chromalveolates is believed to have resulted from a secondary
endosymbiotic event. However, some chromalveolates appear to have lost red alga-derived plastid organelles or lack plastid
genes altogether. Therefore, this supergroup should be considered a hypothesis-based working group that is subject to change.
Chromalveolates include very important photosynthetic organisms, such as diatoms, brown algae, and significant disease
agents in animals and plants. The chromalveolates can be subdivided into alveolates and stramenopiles.
Alveolates: Dinoflagellates, Apicomplexians, and Ciliates
A large body of data supports that the alveolates are derived from a shared common ancestor. The alveolates are named for the
presence of an alveolus, or membrane-enclosed sac, beneath the cell membrane. The exact function of the alveolus is unknown,
but it may be involved in osmoregulation. The alveolates are further categorized into some of the better-known protists: the
dinoflagellates, the apicomplexans, and the ciliates.
Dinoflagellates exhibit extensive morphological diversity and can be photosynthetic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic. The
chloroplast of photosynthetic dinoflagellates was derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga. Many dinoflagellates are
encased in interlocking plates of cellulose. Two perpendicular flagella fit into the grooves between the cellulose plates, with one
flagellum extending longitudinally and a second encircling the dinoflagellate (Figure 23.21). Together, the flagella contribute to
the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates. These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats, and are a
component ofplankton, the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for
larger aquatic organisms.

The ciliates, which includeParameciumandTetrahymena, are a group of protists 10 to 3,000 micrometers in length that are
covered in rows, tufts, or spirals of tiny cilia. By beating their cilia synchronously or in waves, ciliates can coordinate directed
movements and ingest food particles. Certain ciliates have fused cilia-based structures that function like paddles, funnels, or
fins. Ciliates also are surrounded by a pellicle, providing protection without compromising agility. The genusParamecium
includes protists that have organized their cilia into a plate-like primitive mouth, called an oral groove, which is used to capture
and digest bacteria (Figure 23.24). Food captured in the oral groove enters a food vacuole, where it combines with digestive
enzymes. Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane, called the anal
pore. In addition to a vacuole-based digestive system,Parameciumalso usescontractile vacuoles, which are osmoregulatory
vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell. Ciliates therefore
exhibit considerable structural complexity without having achieved multicellularity.

Stramenopiles: Diatoms, Brown Algae, Golden Algae and Oomycetes
The other subgroup of chromalveolates, the stramenopiles, includes photosynthetic marine algae and heterotrophic protists.
The chloroplast of these algae is derived from red alga. The identifying feature of this group is the presence of a textured, or
“hairy,” flagellum. Many stramenopiles also have an additional flagellum that lacks hair-like projections (Figure 23.26). Members
of this subgroup range in size from single-celled diatoms to the massive and multicellular kelp.
Figure23.26Stramenopile flagella. This stramenopile cell has a single hairy flagellum and a secondary smooth flagellum.
The diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of
silicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles (Figure 23.27). These protists are a component of freshwater and marine
plankton. Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually, although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also
exist. Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell, called araphe. By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the
raphe, the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction.

extensive network of filaments that allow for nutrient uptake. As diploid spores, many oomycetes have two oppositely directed
flagella (one hairy and one smooth) for locomotion. The oomycetes are nonphotosynthetic and include many saprobes and
parasites. The saprobes appear as white fluffy growths on dead organisms (Figure 23.29). Most oomycetes are aquatic, but some
parasitize terrestrial plants. One plant pathogen isPhytophthora infestans, the causative agent of late blight of potatoes, such as
occurred in the nineteenth century Irish potato famine.

Parabasalids
A second Excavata subgroup, the parabasalids, are named for the parabasal apparatus, which consists of a Golgi complex
associated with cytoskeletal fibers. Other cytoskeletal features include an axostyle, a bundle of fibers that runs the length of the
cell and may even extend beyond it. Parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling, and these and other cytoskeletal
modifications may assist locomotion. Like the diplomonads, the parabasalids exhibit modified mitochondria. In parabasalids
these structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct.
The parabasalidTrichomonas vaginaliscauses trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease in humans, which appears in an
estimated 180 million cases worldwide each year. Whereas men rarely exhibit symptoms during an infection with this protist,
infected women may become more susceptible to secondary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be
more likely to develop cervical cancer. Pregnant women infected withT. vaginalisare at an increased risk of serious
complications, such as pre-term delivery.
Some of the most complex of the parabasalids are those that colonize the rumen of ruminant animals and the guts of termites.
These organisms can digest cellulose, a metabolic talent that is unusual among eukaryotic cells. They have multiple flagella
arranged in complex patterns and some additionally recruit spirochetes that attach to their surface to act as accessory locomotor
structures.

Euglenozoans
Euglenozoans includes parasites, heterotrophs, autotrophs, and mixotrophs, ranging in size from 10 to 500 µm. Euglenoids
move through their aquatic habitats using two long flagella that guide them toward light sources sensed by a primitive ocular
organ called an eyespot. The familiar genus,Euglena, encompasses some mixotrophic species that display a photosynthetic
capability only when light is present. The chloroplast ofEuglenadescends from a green alga by secondary endosymbiosis. In the
dark, the chloroplasts of Euglena shrink up and temporarily cease functioning, and the cells instead take up organic nutrients
from their environment. Euglena has a tough pellicle composed of bands of protein attached to the cytoskeleton. The bands
spiral around the cell and give Euglena its exceptional flexibility.
The human parasite,Trypanosoma brucei, belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa, the kinetoplastids. The kinetoplastid
subgroup is named after the kinetoplast, a large modified mitochondrion carrying multiple circular DNAs. This subgroup
includes several parasites, collectively called trypanosomes, which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect
species during a portion of their life cycle.T. bruceidevelops in the gut of the tsetse fly after the fly bites an infected human or
other mammalian host. The parasite then travels to the insect salivary glands to be transmitted to another human or other
mammal when the infected tsetse fly consumes another blood meal.T. bruceiis common in central Africa and is the causative
agent of African sleeping sickness, a disease associated with severe chronic fatigue, coma, and can be fatal if left untreated since
it leads to progressive decline of the function of the central nervous system.

## Section 410.1
Ecology of Protists
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the role that protists play in the ecosystem
• Describe important pathogenic species of protists
Protists function in various ecological niches. Whereas some protist species are essential components of the food chain and
generators of biomass, others function in the decomposition of organic materials. Still other protists are dangerous human
pathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases.
Primary Producers/Food Sources
Protists are essential sources of food and provide nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as with zooplankton,
protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms.
Paramecium bursariaand several other species of ciliates aremixotrophicdue to a symbiotic relationship with green algae. This
is a temporary version of the secondarily endosymbiotic chloroplast found inEuglena. But these symbiotic associations are not
restricted to protists. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates calledzooxanthellaeprovide nutrients for the coral polyps
(Figure 23.32) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete their calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals
provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic
relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a
process calledcoral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reef-building corals typically do not reside in waters
deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.

The protists and their products of photosynthesis are essential—directly or indirectly—to the survival of organisms ranging
from bacteria to mammals (Figure 23.33). As primary producers, protists feed a large proportion of the world’s aquatic species.
(On land, terrestrial plants serve as primary producers.) In fact, approximately 25 percent of the world’s photosynthesis is
conducted by photosynthetic protists, particularly dinoflagellates, diatoms, and multicellular algae.

Protists do not create food sources only for sea-dwelling organisms. Recall that certain anaerobic parabasalid species exist in the
digestive tracts of termites and wood-eating cockroaches, where they contribute an essential step in the digestion of cellulose
ingested by these insects as they consume wood.

Trypanosomes
Trypanosoma brucei(Figure 23.35), transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossinaspp) in Africa, and related flies in South America, is an
flagellated endoparasite responsible for the deadly disease nagana in cattle and horses, and for African sleeping sickness in
humans. This trypanosome confounds the human immune system by changing its thick layer of surface glycoproteins with each
infectious cycle. (The glycoproteins are identified by the immune system as foreign antigens, and a specific antibody defense is
mounted against the parasite.) However,T.bruceihas thousands of possible antigens, and with each subsequent generation,
the protist switches to a glycoprotein coating with a different molecular structure. In this way,T.bruceiis capable of replicating
continuously without the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite. Without treatment,T.bruceiattacks red
blood cells, causing the patient to lapse into a coma and eventually die. During epidemic periods, mortality from the disease can
be high. Greater surveillance and control measures lead to a reduction in reported cases; some of the lowest numbers reported
in 50 years (fewer than 10,000 cases in all of sub-Saharan Africa) have happened since 2009.

In Latin America, another species of trypanosome,T.cruzi, is responsible for Chagas disease.T.cruziinfections are mainly
caused by a blood-sucking “kissing bug” in the genusTriatoma. These “true bugs” bite the host during the night and then
defecate on the wound, transmitting the trypanosome to the victim. The victim scratches the wound, further inoculating the
site with trypanosomes at the location of the bite. After about 10 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase but most never
develop further symptoms. In about 30 percent of cases, however, the trypanosome causes further damage, especially to the
heart and digestive system tissues in the chronic phase of infection, leading to malnutrition and heart failure due to abnormal
heart rhythms. An estimated 10 million people are infected with Chagas disease, and it caused 10,000 deaths in 2008.

Characteristics of Fungi
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the characteristics of fungi
• Describe the composition of the mycelium
• Describe the mode of nutrition of fungi
• Explain sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi
Fungi, once considered plant-like organisms, are more closely related to animals than plants. Fungi are not
capable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources
of energy and carbon. Fungi share a few other traits with animals. Their cell walls are composed of chitin,
which is found in the exoskeletons of arthropods. Fungi produce a number of pigments, including
melanin,also found in the hair and skin of animals. Like animals, fungi also store carbohydrates as glycogen.
However, like bacteria, fungi absorb nutrients across the cell surface and act as decomposers, helping to
recycle nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules.
Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and
sexual reproduction with alternation of generations. Most fungi produce a large number ofspores, which
are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals.
Fungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations. For example,
most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi. The roots of the plant connect with the
underground parts of the fungus, which formmycorrhizae. Through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant
exchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species. Alternatively, lichens are an
association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga).
Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. For example, Dutch elm disease, which is caused
by the fungusOphiostoma ulmi, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many
native species of elm (Ulmussp.) by infecting the tree’s vascular system. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector,
transmitting the disease from tree to tree. Accidentally introduced in the 1900s, the fungus decimated elm
trees across the continent. Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than
American elms.
In humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat. Unlike bacteria, fungi do not
respond to traditional antibiotic therapy, since they are eukaryotes. Fungal infections may prove deadly for
individuals with compromised immune systems.
Fungi have many commercial applications. The food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and cheese and
wine making. Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation. Fungi are the source of
many commercial enzymes and antibiotics.
Although humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times, until recently, the biology of
fungi was poorly understood. In fact, up until the mid-20th century, many scientists classified fungi as
plants! Fungi, like plants, are mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place. They possess a stem-like
structure similar to plants, as well as having a root-like fungal mycelium in the soil. In addition, their mode
of nutrition was poorly understood. Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result ofmycology: the
scientific study of fungi. Based on fossil evidence, fungi appeared in the pre-Cambrian era, about 450
million years ago. Molecular biology analysis of the fungal genome demonstrates that fungi are more closely
related to animals than plants. Under some current systematic phylogenies, they continue to be a
polyphyletic groupof organisms that share characteristics, rather than sharing a single common ancestor.

a biological science (preferably majoring in microbiology) and a master's degree in mycology are minimally necessary.
Mycologists can specialize in taxonomy and fungal genomics, molecular and cellular biology, plant pathology, biotechnology, or
biochemistry. Some medical microbiologists concentrate on the study of infectious diseases caused by fungi, called mycoses.
Mycologists collaborate with zoologists and plant pathologists to identify and control difficult fungal infections, such as the
devastating chestnut blight, the mysterious decline in frog populations in many areas of the world, or the deadly epidemic called
white nose syndrome, which is decimating bats in the Eastern United States.
Government agencies hire mycologists as research scientists and technicians to monitor the health of crops, national parks, and
national forests. Mycologists are also employed in the private sector by companies that develop chemical and biological control
products or new agricultural products, and by companies that provide disease control services. Because of the key role played by
fungi in the fermentation of alcohol and the preparation of many important foods, scientists with a good understanding of
fungal physiology routinely work in the food technology industry. Oenology, the science of wine making, relies not only on the
knowledge of grape varietals and soil composition, but also on a solid understanding of the characteristics of the wild yeasts
that thrive in different wine-making regions. It is possible to purchase yeast strains isolated from specific grape-growing
regions. The great French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, made many of his essential discoveries working on the
humble brewer’s yeast, thus discovering the process offermentation.
Cell Structure and Function
Fungi are eukaryotes, and as such, have a complex cellular organization. As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound
nucleus. The DNA in the nucleus is wrapped around histone proteins, as is observed in other eukaryotic cells. A few types of
fungi have accessory genomic structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of DNA); however, the horizontal transfer of
genetic information that occurs between one bacterium and another rarely occurs in fungi. Fungal cells also contain
mitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.
Unlike plant cells, fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll. Many fungi display bright colors arising from other
cellular pigments, ranging from red to green to black. The poisonousAmanita muscaria(fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright
red cap with white patches (Figure 24.2). Pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against
ultraviolet radiation. Some fungal pigments are toxic to humans.

Like plant cells, fungal cells have a thick cell wall. The rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex polysaccharides called
chitinandglucans. Chitin(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine), also found in the exoskeleton of arthropods such as insects, gives
structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The wall protects the cell from desiccation and some predators. Fungi have plasma
membranes similar to those of other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized byergosterol: a steroid molecule that
replaces the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. However, flagella
are produced by the spores and gametes in the primitive Phylum Chytridiomycota.
Growth
The vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellularthallus. Unicellular fungi are called yeasts. Multicellular fungi
produce threadlikehyphae(singular hypha). Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending
on environmental conditions.Saccharomyces cerevisiae(baker’s yeast) andCandidaspecies (the agents of thrush, a common

Fungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic, and can grow with or without light. They vary in their oxygen
requirement. Most fungi areobligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. Other species, such as members of the
Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, areobligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because
oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them. Yeasts are intermediate, beingfacultative anaerobes. This means that they
grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration, but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not
available. The alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production.
Nutrition
Like animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon, rather than fix carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants. In addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Like
animals, they must obtain it from their diet. However, unlike most animals, which ingest food and then digest it internally in
specialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order; digestion precedes ingestion. First,exoenzymesare
transported out of the hyphae, where they process nutrients in the environment. Then, the smaller molecules produced by this
external digestionare absorbed through the large surface area of the mycelium. As with animal cells, the polysaccharide of
storage isglycogen, a branched polysaccaride, rather than amylopectin, a less densely branched polysaccharide, and amylose, a
linear polysaccharide, as found in plants.
Fungi are mostlysaprobes(saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.
They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic material derived mainly from plants. Fungal exoenzymes are
able to break down insoluble compounds, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose
molecules. The carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are thus released into the environment. Because of their varied metabolic
pathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools inbioremediationof chemically
damaged ecosystems. For example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Other species take up heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead.
Some fungi are parasitic, infecting either plants or animals. Smut and Dutch elm disease affect plants, whereas athlete’s foot
and candidiasis (thrush) are medically important fungal infections in humans. In environments poor in nitrogen, some fungi
resort to predation of nematodes (small non-segmented roundworms). In fact, species ofArthrobotrysfungi have a number of
mechanisms to trap nematodes: One mechanism involves constricting rings within the network of hyphae. The rings swell when
they touch the nematode, gripping it in a tight hold. The fungus then penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized
hyphae calledhaustoria. Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria, as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host, release

Figure24.8Generalized fungal life cycle. Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction.
There are many types of asexual spores.Conidiosporesare unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the
tip or side of the hypha. Other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form single cells that are released as
spores; some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment. Yet others bud off the vegetative parent cell. In contrast to
conidiospores, sporangiospores are produced directly from a sporangium (Figure 24.9).

## Section 421.1
Classifications of Fungi
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify fungi and place them into the five major phyla according to current classification
• Describe each phylum in terms of major representative species and patterns of reproduction
The kingdom Fungi contains five major phyla that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction or using
molecular data. Polyphyletic, unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, were once placed for convenience in a sixth
group, the Deuteromycota, called a “form phylum,” because superficially they appeared to be similar. However, most mycologists
have discontinued this practice. Rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) continue
to show new and different relationships among the various categories of fungi.
The five true phyla of fungi are the Chytridiomycota (Chytrids), the Zygomycota (conjugated fungi), the Ascomycota (sac fungi),
the Basidiomycota (club fungi) and the recently described Phylum Glomeromycota (Figure 24.10).
Figure24.10Fungal phyla. Note: “-mycota” is used to designate a phylum while “-mycetes” formally denotes a class or is used informally
to refer to all members of the phylum.
Chytridiomycota: The Chytrids

Eumycota, or true fungi. The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late pre-
Cambrian period, more than 500million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of
chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; however, a few form multicellular organisms
and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). The Chytrids are the only fungi that have retained flagella. They
produce both gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. An unusual feature of the chytrids is
that both male and female gametes are flagellated.
The ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic
environments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure
24.11), while others are saprobes. The chytrid speciesAllomycesis well characterized as an experimental organism. Its
reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases.Allomycesproduces diploid or haploid flagellated zoospores in a
sporangium.

decline and extinction. (credit: modification of work by Johnson ML, Speare R., CDC)
Zygomycota: The Conjugated Fungi
The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the PhylumZygomycota. They include the familiar bread
mold,Rhizopus stolonifer, which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads, fruits, and vegetables. Most species are
saprobes, living off decaying organic material; a few are parasites, particularly of insects. Zygomycetes play a considerable
commercial role. For example, the metabolic products of some species ofRhizopusare intermediates in the synthesis of semi-
synthetic steroid hormones.
Zygomycetes have a thallus of coenocytic hyphae in which the nuclei are haploid when the organism is in the vegetative stage.
The fungi usually reproduce asexually by producing sporangiospores (Figure 24.12). The black tips of bread mold are the swollen
sporangia packed with black spores (Figure 24.13). When spores land on a suitable substrate, they germinate and produce a new

Ascomycota: The Sac Fungi
The majority of known fungi belong to the PhylumAscomycota, which is characterized by the formation of anascus(plural,
asci), a sac-like structure that contains haploidascospores. Filamentous ascomycetes produce hyphae divided by perforated
septa, allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to another. Conidia and asci, which are used respectively for asexual and
sexual reproduction, are usually separated from the vegetative hyphae by blocked (non-perforated) septa. Many ascomycetes are
of commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role for humanity, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine
fermentation, and directly as food delicacies such as truffles and morels.Aspergillus oryzaeis used in the fermentation of rice to
produce sake. Other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals, including humans. For example, fungal pneumonia poses a
significant threat to AIDS patients who have a compromised immune system. Ascomycetes not only infest and destroy crops
directly; they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for consumption.
Asexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploidconidiospores(Figure 24.14).
Sexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either one of two types of mating strains (Figure 24.14).
The “male” strain produces an antheridium and the “female” strain develops an ascogonium. At fertilization, the antheridium
and the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy, without nuclear fusion. Special dikaryotic ascogenous (ascus-producing) hyphae
arise from thisdikaryon, in which each cell has pairs of nuclei: one from the “male” strain and one from the “female” strain. In
each ascus, two haploid nuclei fuse in karyogamy. Thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called theascocarp. The diploid nucleus
in each ascus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis, and spore walls form around each nucleus. The spores in each ascus contain
the meiotic products of a single diploid nucleus. The ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are
disseminated in the environment and start new mycelia (Figure 24.15).

Basidiomycota: The Club Fungi
The fungi in the PhylumBasidiomycotaare easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club-shaped fruiting bodies
calledbasidia(singular,basidium), which are the swollen terminal cells of hyphae. The basidia, which are the reproductive
organs of these fungi, are often contained within the familiar mushroom, commonly seen in fields after rain, on the
supermarket shelves, and growing on your lawn (Figure 24.16). These mushroom-producing basidiomycetes are sometimes
referred to as“gill fungi”because of the presence of gill-like structures on the underside of the cap. The gills are actually
compacted hyphaeon which the basidia are borne. This group also includes shelf fungi, which cling to the bark of trees like
small shelves. In addition, the basidiomycota include smuts and rusts, which are important plant pathogens. Most edible fungi
belong to the Phylum Basidiomycota; however, some basidiomycota are inedible and produce deadly toxins. For example,
Cryptococcus neoformanscauses severe respiratory illness. The infamous death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides) is related
to the fly agaric seen at the beginning of the previous section.

Imperfect fungi—those that do not display a sexual phase—were formerly classified in the form phylumDeuteromycota, an
invalid taxon no longer used in the present, ever-developing classification of organisms. While Deuteromycota was once a
classification taxon, recent molecular analysis has shown that some of the members classified in this group belong to the
Ascomycota (Figure 24.18) or the Basidiomycota. Because some members of this group have not yet been appropriately

Ecology of Fungi
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the role of fungi in various ecosystems
• Describe mutualistic relationships of fungi with plant roots and photosynthetic organisms
• Describe the beneficial relationship between some fungi and insects
Fungi play a crucial role in the constantly changing “balance” of ecosystems. They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring
dark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful
symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms like algae to produce lichens. Within their communities, fungi are not as obvious as
are large animals or tall treas. Like bacteria, they act behind the scene as major decomposers. With their versatile metabolism,
fungi break down organic matter, which would otherwise not be recycled.
Habitats
Although fungi are primarily associated with humid and cool environments that provide a supply of organic matter, they
colonize a surprising diversity of habitats, from seawater to human skin and mucous membranes. Chytrids are found primarily
in aquatic environments. Other fungi, such asCoccidioides immitis, which causes pneumonia when its spores are inhaled,

thrive in the dry and sandy soil of the southwestern United States. Fungi that parasitize coral reefs live in the ocean. However,
most members of the Kingdom Fungi grow on the forest floor, where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris
from plants and animals. In these environments, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers, making it possible for
members of the other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and live.
Decomposers and Recyclers
The food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter (Figure 24.19). Some elements—such as
nitrogen and phosphorus—are required in large quantities by biological systems, and yet are not abundant in the environment.
The action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter, making them available to other living organisms. Trace
elements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential for growth, and would remain tied up in rotting organic matter
if fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolic activity.
Figure24.19Bracket fungi. Fungi are an important part of ecosystem nutrient cycles. These bracket fungi growing on the side of a tree are
the fruiting structures of a basidiomycete. They receive their nutrients through their hyphae, which invade and decay the tree trunk. (credit:
Cory Zanker)
The ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition. As seen earlier, digestion
precedes ingestion. Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients. The enzymes are either released into the
substrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall. Large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which
are transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane. Because the movement of small
molecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of
moisture in the environment.
As saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat. In addition to
replenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, and sometimes
damaging, ways (Figure 24.20).

Other examples of fungus–plant mutualism include the endophytes: fungi that live inside tissue without damaging the host
plant. Endophytes release toxins that repel herbivores, or confer resistance to environmental stress factors, such as infection by
microorganisms, drought, or heavy metals in soil.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Coevolution of Land Plants and Mycorrhizae
As we have seen, mycorrhizae are the fungal partners of a mutually beneficial symbiotic association that coevolved between
roots of vascular plants and fungi. A well-supported theory proposes that fungi were instrumental in the evolution of the root
system in plants and contributed to the success of Angiosperms. The bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), which are considered
the most ancestral plants and the first to survive and adapt on land, have simple underground rhizoids, rather than a true root

protection; the (b) algal zone where photosynthesis occurs, the (c) medulla of fungal hyphae, and the (d) lower cortex, which also provides
protection and may have (e)rhizinesto anchor the thallus to the substrate.
The thallus of lichens grows very slowly, expanding its diameter a few millimeters per year. Both the fungus and the alga
participate in the formation of dispersal units, called soredia—clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia. Soredia are
dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens.
Lichens are extremely sensitive to air pollution, especially to abnormal levels of nitrogenous and sulfurous compounds. The U.S.
Forest Service and National Park Service can monitor air quality by measuring the relative abundance and health of the lichen
population in an area. Lichens fulfill many ecological roles. Caribou and reindeer eat lichens, and they provide cover for small
invertebrates that hide in the mycelium. In the production of textiles, weavers used lichens to dye wool for many centuries until
the advent of synthetic dyes. The pigments used in litmus paper are also extracted from lichens.
LINK TO LEARNING
Lichens are used to monitor the quality of air. Read more on thissite(http://openstax.org/l/lichen_monitrng)from the United
States Forest Service.
Fungus/Animal Mutualism
Fungi have evolved mutualisms with numerous insects in Phylum Arthropoda: joint-legged invertebrates with a chitinous
exoskeleton. Arthropods depend on the fungus for protection from predators and pathogens, while the fungus obtains nutrients
and a way to disseminate spores into new environments. The association between species of Basidiomycota and scale insects is
one example. The fungal mycelium covers and protects the insect colonies. The scale insects foster a flow of nutrients from the
parasitized plant to the fungus.
In a second example, leaf-cutter ants of Central and South America literally farm fungi. They cut disks of leaves from plants and
pile them up in subterranean gardens (Figure 24.25). Fungi are cultivated in these disk gardens, digesting the cellulose in the
leaves that the ants cannot break down. Once smaller sugar molecules are produced and consumed by the fungi, the fungi in
turn become a meal for the ants. The insects also patrol their garden, preying on competing fungi. Both ants and fungi benefit
from this mutualistic association. The fungus receives a steady supply of leaves and freedom from competition, while the ants
feed on the fungi they cultivate.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe some fungal parasites and pathogens of plants
• Describe the different types of fungal infections in humans
• Explain why antifungal therapy is hampered by the similarity between fungal and animal cells
Parasitismdescribes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other. Both
parasites and pathogens harm the host; however, pathogens cause disease, damage to host tissues or physiology, whereas
parasites usually do not, but can cause serious damage and death by competition for nutrients or other resources.
Commensalismoccurs when one member benefits without affecting the other.
Plant Parasites and Pathogens
The production of sufficient high-quality crops is essential to human existence. Unfortunately, plant diseases have ruined many
crops throughout human agricultural history, sometimes creating widespread famine. Many plant pathogens are fungi that
cause tissue decay and the eventual death of the host (Figure 24.26). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant
pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins that can further damage and kill the host plant. Fungi are also responsible for
food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungusClaviceps purpureacauses ergot, a disease of cereal crops
(especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and
animals are of much greater significance. In animals, the disease is referred to asergotism. The most common signs and
symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot islysergic acid,
which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal
pathogens that affect crops.

Aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic compounds released by fungi of the genusAspergillus. Periodically, harvests of nuts and
grains are tainted by aflatoxins, leading to massive recall of produce. This sometimes ruins producers and causes food shortages
in developing countries.
Animal and Human Parasites and Pathogens
Fungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways. Amycosisis a fungal disease that results from infection and direct
damage due to the growth and infiltration of the fungus. Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues.
Mycotoxicosisis the poisoning of humans (and other animals) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins (mycotoxins).
Mycetismusspecifically describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms. In addition, individuals who
display hypersensitivity to molds and spores may develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. Fungal infections are
generally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes. Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas
compounds that kill fungi also harm the eukaryotic animal host.
Many fungal infections aresuperficial; that is, they occur on the animal’s skin. Termedcutaneous(“skin”)mycoses, they can have
devastating effects. For example, the decline of the world’s frog population in recent years is caused (in part) by the chytrid
fungusBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This deadly fungus infects the skin of frogs and presumably interferes with cutaneous
gaseous exchange, which is essential for amphibian survival. Similarly, more than a million bats in the United States have been
killed by white-nose syndrome, which appears as a white ring around the mouth of the bat. It is caused by the cold-loving
fungusPseudogymnoascus destructans, which disseminates its deadly spores in caves where bats hibernate. Mycologists are
researching the transmission, mechanism, and control ofP. destructansto stop its spread.
Fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue (Figure 24.27).
These fungi are often misnamed “dermatophytes”, from the Greek wordsdermismeaning skin andphytemeaning plant,
although they are not plants. Dermatophytes are also called“ringworms”because of the red ring they cause on skin. They secrete

Importance of Fungi in Human Life
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the importance of fungi to the balance of the environment
• Summarize the role of fungi in agriculture and food and beverage preparation
• Describe the importance of fungi in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries
• Discuss the role of fungi as model organisms
Although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food, they are vitally important to human life on many
levels. As we have seen, fungi influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they are part of the
nutrient cycle in ecosystems. They have other ecosystem roles as well. As animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population
of damaging pests. These fungi are very specific to the insects they attack, and do not infect other animals or plants. Fungi are
currently under investigation as potential microbial insecticides, with several already on the market. For example, the fungus
Beauveria bassianais being tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer a beetle that
feeds on ash trees. It has been released in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland (Figure 24.28).

brewing industry in the late 1850s. This was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting.
Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or
inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. Important antibiotics, such as penicillin
and the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug
cyclosporine(which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids
used to stop bleeding. Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such asPsilocybe semilanceataandGymnopilus junonius,which
have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years.
As simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. Many advances in modern genetics were

membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant
DNA technology experiments. Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to
genetic modification.

The kingdom Plantae constitutes large and varied groups of organisms. There are more than 300,000 species
of catalogued plants. Of these, more than 260,000 are seed plants. Mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering
plants are all members of the plant kingdom. Land plants arose within the Archaeplastida, which includes
the red algae (Rhodophyta) and two groups of green algae, Chlorophyta and Charaphyta. Most biologists also

## Section 437.1
• Early Plant Life 643
Early land plants, like the early land animals, did not live very far from an abundant source of water and developed survival
strategies to combat dryness. One of these strategies is called tolerance. Many mosses, for example, can dry out to a brown and
brittle mat, but as soon as rain or a flood makes water available, mosses will absorb it and are restored to their healthy green
appearance. Another strategy is to colonize environments with high humidity, where droughts are uncommon. Ferns, which are
considered an early lineage of plants, thrive in damp and cool places such as the understory of temperate forests. Later, plants
moved away from moist or aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation, rather than tolerance. These plants, like cacti,
minimize the loss of water to such an extent they can survive in extremely dry environments.
The most successful adaptation solution was the development of new structures that gave plants the advantage when colonizing
new and dry environments. Four major adaptations contribute to the success of terrestrial plants. The first adaptation is that the
life cycle in all land plants exhibits the alternation of generations, a sporophyte in which the spores are formed and a
gametophyte that produces gametes. Second is an apical meristem tissue in roots and shoots. Third is the evolution of a waxy
cuticle to resist desiccation (absent from some mosses). Finally cell walls with lignin to support structures off the ground. These
adaptations all contribute to the success of the land plants, but are noticeably lacking in the closely related green algae—another
reason for the debate over their placement in the plant kingdom. They are also not all found in the mosses, which can be
regarded as representing an intermediate stage in adaptation to land.
Alternation of Generations
All sexually reproducing organisms have both haploid and diploid cells in their life cycles. In organisms withhaplonticlife
cycles, the haploid stage is dominant, while in organisms with adiplonticlife cycle, the diploid stage is the dominant life stage.
Dominantin this context means both the stage in which the organism spends most of its time, and the stage in which most
mitotic cell reproduction occurs—the multicellular stage. In haplontic life cycles, the only diploid cell is the zygote, which
undergoes immediate meiosis to restore the haploid state. In diplontic life cycles, the only haploid cells are the gametes, which
combine to restore the diploid state at their earliest convenience. Humans, for example, are diplontic.
Alternation of generations describes a life cycle in which an organism has both haploid and diploid multicellular stages (Figure
25.2). This type of life cycle, which is found in all plants, is described ashaplodiplontic.
Figure25.2Alternation of generations between the 1ngametophyte and 2nsporophyte is shown. Mitosis occurs in both gametophyte and
sporophyte generations. Diploid sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, while haploid gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis.
(credit: Peter Coxhead)
In alternation of generations, the multicellular haploid form, known as a gametophyte, is followed in the developmental
sequence by a multicellular diploid form, the sporophyte. The gametophyte gives rise to the gametes (reproductive cells) by
mitosis. This can be the most obvious phase of the life cycle of the plant, as in the mosses, or it can occur in a microscopic
structure, such as a pollen grain, in the seed plants. The evolution of the land plants is marked by increasing prominence of the
sporophyte generation. The sporophyte stage is barely noticeable in non-vascular plants (the collective term for the plants that
include the liverworts and mosses). In the seed plants, the sporophyte phase can be a towering tree, as in sequoias and pines.
Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and
other environmental hazards. In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to
the embryo as it develops into the new sporophyte. This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name
ofembryophytes.
Sporangia in Seedless Plants
The sporophyte of seedless plants is diploid and results from syngamy (fusion) of two gametes. The sporophyte bears the

cells causes the organ to grow and elongate. The root cap protects the fragile apical meristem as the root tip is pushed through the soil by
cell elongation.
Additional Land Plant Adaptations
As plants adapted to dry land and became independent from the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and
structures made their appearance. Early land plants did not grow more than a few inches off the ground, competing for light on
these low mats. By developing a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light. Because air offers substantially
less support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks). In small plants
such as single-celled algae, simple diffusion suffices to distribute water and nutrients throughout the organism. However, for
plants to evolve larger forms, the evolution of a conductive tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a prerequisite.
The evolution of vascular tissue in plants met both of these needs. The vascular system contains two types of conductive tissue:
xylem and phloem. Xylem conducts water and minerals absorbed from the soil up to the shoot, while phloem transports food
derived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant. In xylem, the cells walls are reinforced with lignin, whose tough
hydrophobic polymers help prevent the seepage of water across the xylem cell walls. Lignin also adds to the strength of these
tissues in supporting the plant. The vascular tissues extend into the root of land plants. The root system evolved to take up water
and minerals from the soil, and to anchor the increasingly taller shoot in the soil.
In land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle protects the leaves and stems from desiccation. However, the cuticle also
prevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. To overcome this, stomata
or pores that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor appeared in plants as they moved away from moist
environments into drier habitats.
Water filters ultraviolet-B (UVB) light, which is harmful to all organisms, especially those that must absorb light to survive. This
filtering does not occur for land plants. Exposure to damaging radiation presented an additional challenge to land colonization,
which was met by the evolution of biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of protective flavonoids and other pigments that
absorb UV wavelengths of light and protect the aerial parts of plants from photodynamic damage.
Plants cannot avoid being eaten by animals. Instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex
organic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals. These toxic compounds can also
cause severe diseases and even death, thus discouraging predation. Humans have used many of these compounds for centuries
as drugs, medications, or spices. In contrast, as plants co-evolved with animals, the development of sweet and nutritious
metabolites lured animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds. Plants have been
enlisting animals to be their helpers in this way for hundreds of millions of years.
Evolution of Land Plants
No discussion of the evolution of plants on land can be undertaken without a brief review of the timeline of the geological eras.
The early era, known as the Paleozoic, is divided into six periods. It starts with the Cambrian period, followed by the Ordovician,
Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. The major event to mark the Ordovician, more than 500 million years ago, was
the colonization of land by the ancestors of modern land plants. Fossilized cells, cuticles, and spores of early land plants have

molecular biology is the identification of oleanane, a compound that deters pests. Up to this point, oleanane appeared to be
unique to flowering plants; however, it has now been recovered from sediments dating from the Permian, much earlier than the
current dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants. Paleobotanists can also study fossil DNA, which can yield a
large amount of information, by analyzing and comparing the DNA sequences of extinct plants with those of living and related
organisms. Through this analysis, evolutionary relationships can be built for plant lineages.
Some paleobotanists are skeptical of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of molecular fossils. For example, the chemical
materials of interest degrade rapidly when exposed to air during their initial isolation, as well as in further manipulations. There
is always a high risk of contaminating the specimens with extraneous material, mostly from microorganisms. Nevertheless, as
technology is refined, the analysis of DNA from fossilized plants will provide invaluable information on the evolution of plants
and their adaptation to an ever-changing environment.
The Major Divisions of Land Plants
The green algae and land plants are grouped together into a subphylum called the Streptophyta, and thus are called
Streptophytes. In a further division, land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of
vascular tissue, as detailed inFigure 25.6. Plants that lack vascular tissue, which is formed of specialized cells for the transport
of water and nutrients, are referred to asnon-vascular plants. Liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless, non-vascular
plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution. Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and
solutes. The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician (500 to 435 MYA) and were probably similar to lycophytes, which
include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). Lycophytes
and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants, because they do not produce seeds. The seed plants, or
spermatophytes, form the largest group of all existing plants, and hence dominate the landscape. Seed plants include
gymnosperms, most notably conifers, which produce “naked seeds,” and the most successful of all plants, the flowering plants
(angiosperms). Angiosperms protect their seeds inside chambers at the center of a flower; the walls of the chamber later develop
into a fruit.

Green Algae: Precursors of Land Plants
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the traits shared by green algae and land plants
• Explain why charophytes are considered the closest algal relative to land plants
• Explain how current phylogenetic relationships are reshaped by comparative analysis of DNA sequences
Streptophytes
Until recently, all photosynthetic eukaryotes were classified as members of the kingdom Plantae. The brown and golden algae,
however, are now reassigned to the protist supergroup Chromalveolata. This is because apart from their ability to capture light
energy and fix CO2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that are characteristic of plants. The plants are now
classified, along with the red and green algae, in the protist supergroup Archaeplastida. Green algae contain the same
carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of
chlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch. Their
cells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants. Which
of the green algae to include among the plants has not been phylogenetically resolved.
Green algae fall into two major groups, the chlorophytes and the charophytes. The chlorophytes include the generaChlorella,
Chlamydomonas, the “sea lettuce”Ulva, and the colonial algaVolvox. The charophytes include desmids, as well as the genera
Spirogyra,Coleochaete, andChara. There are familiar green algae in both groups. Some green algae are single cells, such as
Chlamydomonasand desmids, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular. Other
green algae, likeVolvox, form colonies, and some, likeUlvaare multicellular (Figure 25.7).Spirogyrais a long filament of colonial
cells. Most members of this genus live in fresh water, brackish water, seawater, or even in snow patches. A few green algae can
survive on soil, provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture within which they can live. Periodic dry spells provide a selective
advantage to algae that can survive water stress.

bar data from Matt Russell)
The chlorophytes and the charophytes differ in a few respects that, in addition to molecular analysis, place the land plants as a
sister group of the charophytes. First, cells in charophytes and the land plants divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, in
which microtubules parallel to the spindle serve as guides for the vesicles of the forming cell plate. In the chlorophytes, the cell
plate is organized by a phycoplast, in which the microtubules are perpendicular to the spindle. Second, only the charophytes and
the land plants have plasmodesmata, or intercellular channels that allow the transfer of materials from cell to cell. In the
chlorophytes, intercellular connections do not persist in mature multicellular forms. Finally, both charophytes and the land
plants showapical growth—growth from the tips of the plant rather than throughout the plant body. Consequently, land plants
and the charophytes are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta.
Reproduction of Green Algae
Green algae reproduce both asexually, by fragmentation or dispersal of spores, or sexually, by producing gametes that fuse
during fertilization. In a single-celled organism such asChlamydomonas, there is no mitosis after fertilization. In the
multicellularUlva, a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization (and thus exhibits alternation of generations). Both
ChlamydomonasandUlvaproduce flagellated gametes.
Charophytes
The charophytes include several different algal orders that have each been suggested to be the closest relatives of the land plants:
the Charales, the Zygnematales, and the Coleochaetales. The Charales can be traced back 420 million years. They live in a range
of freshwater habitats and vary in size from a few millimeters to a meter in length. The representative genus isChara(Figure

Bryophytes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify the main characteristics of bryophytes
• Describe the distinguishing traits of liverworts, hornworts, and mosses
• Chart the development of land adaptations in the bryophytes
• Describe the events in the bryophyte lifecycle
Bryophytesare the closest extant relatives of early terrestrial plants. The first bryophytes (liverworts) most likely appeared in the
Ordovician period, about 450 million years ago. Because they lack lignin and other resistant structures, the likelihood of
bryophytes forming fossils is rather small. Some spores protected bysporopolleninhave survived and are attributed to early
bryophytes. By the Silurian period (435 MYA), however, vascular plants had spread through the continents. This compelling fact
is used as evidence that non-vascular plants must have preceded the Silurian period.
More than 25,000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats, although some live in deserts. They constitute the major
flora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages.
They generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids (xylem cells specialized for water conduction). Rather, water and
nutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells. Although the termnon-tracheophyteis more accurate, bryophytes are
commonly callednon-vascular plants.
In a bryophyte, all the conspicuous vegetative organs—including the photosynthetic leaf-like structures, the thallus (“plant
body”), stem, and the rhizoid that anchors the plant to its substrate—belong to the haploid organism or gametophyte. The male
gametes formed by bryophytes swim with a flagellum, so fertilization is dependent on the presence of water. The bryophyte

embryo also remains attached to the parent plant, which protects and nourishes it. Thesporophytethat develops from the
embryo is barely noticeable. Thesporangium—the multicellular sexual reproductive structure in which meiosis produces
haploid spores—is present in bryophytes and absent in the majority of algae. This is also a characteristic of land plants.
The bryophytes are divided into three phyla: the liverworts or Marchantiophyta, the hornworts or Anthocerotophyta, and the
mosses or true Bryophyta.
Liverworts
Liverworts(Marchantiophyta) are currently classified as the plants most closely related to the ancestor of vascular plants that
adapted to terrestrial environments. In fact, liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on Earth and diversified to more
than 7000 existing species (Figure 25.9). Lobate liverworts form a flat thallus, with lobes that have a vague resemblance to the
lobes of the liver (Figure 25.10), which accounts for the name given to the phylum. Leafy liverworts have tiny leaflike structures
attached to a stalk. Several leafy liverworts are shown inFigure 25.9.

Hornworts
The defining characteristic of the hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) is the narrow, pipe-like sporophyte. Hornworts have colonized
a variety of habitats on land, although they are never far from a source of moisture. The short, blue-green gametophyte is the
dominant phase of the life cycle of a hornwort. The sporophytes emerge from the parent gametophyte and continue to grow
throughout the life of the plant (Figure 25.12).

Stomata (air pores that can be opened and closed) appear in the hornworts and are abundant on the sporophyte. Photosynthetic
cells in the thallus each contain a single chloroplast. Meristem cells at the base of the plant keep dividing and adding to the
height of the sporophyte. This growth pattern is unique to the hornworts. Many hornworts establish symbiotic relationships

antheridia (male organs) produce many sperm, whereas the archegonia (the female organs) each form a single egg at the base
(venter) of a flask-shaped structure. The archegonium produces attractant substances and at fertilization, the sperm swims
down the neck to the venter and unites with the egg inside the archegonium. The zygote, protected by the archegonium, divides
and grows into a sporophyte, still attached by its foot to the gametophyte.

Seedless Vascular Plants
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify the new traits that first appear in seedless tracheophytes
• Discuss how each trait is important for adaptation to life on land
• Identify the classes of seedless tracheophytes
• Describe the life cycle of a fern
• Explain the role of seedless plants in the ecosystem
The vascular plants, ortracheophytes, are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants. More than 260,000 species
of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth’s vegetation. Several evolutionary innovations explain their success
and their ability to spread to all habitats.
Bryophytes may have been successful at the transition from an aquatic habitat to land, but they are still dependent on water for
reproduction, and must absorb moisture and nutrients through the gametophyte surface. The lack of roots for absorbing water
and minerals from the soil, as well as a lack of lignin-reinforced conducting cells, limit bryophytes to small sizes. Although they
may survive in reasonably dry conditions, they cannot reproduce and expand their habitat range in the absence of water.
Vascular plants, on the other hand, can achieve enormous heights, thus competing successfully for light. Photosynthetic organs
become leaves, and pipe-like cells or vascular tissues transport water, minerals, and fixed carbon organic compounds
throughout the organism.
Throughout plant evolution, there is a progressive increase in the dominance of the sporophyte generation. In seedless vascular
plants, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle. The gametophyte is now less conspicuous, but still
independent of the sporophyte. Seedless vascular plants still depend on water during fertilization, as the flagellated sperm must
swim on a layer of moisture to reach the egg. This step in reproduction explains why ferns and their relatives are more abundant
in damp environments.
Vascular Tissue: Xylem and Phloem
The first plant fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue date to the Silurian period, about 430million years ago. The
simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem.Xylemis the tissue

factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs. The tissue consists of conducting cells, known as tracheids, and
supportive filler tissue, called parenchyma. Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compoundlignininto their walls, and are
thus described as lignified. Lignin itself is a complex polymer: It is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength on
vascular tissue. With their rigid cell walls, the xylem cells provide support to the plant and allow it to achieve impressive heights.
Tall plants have a selective advantage by being able to reach unfiltered sunlight and disperse their spores or seeds away from the
parent plant, thus expanding the species’ range. By growing higher than other plants, tall trees cast their shadows on shorter
plants and thereby outcompete them for water and precious nutrients in the soil.
Phloemis the second type of vascular tissue; it transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes throughout the plant. Phloem cells
are divided into sieve elements (conducting cells) and cells that support thesieve elements. Together, xylem and phloem tissues
form the vascular system of plants (Figure 25.16).

Roots: Support for the Plant
Roots are not well-preserved in the fossil record. Nevertheless, it seems that roots appeared later in evolution than vascular
tissue. The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants. Thin rhizoids
attached bryophytes to the substrate, but these rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; nor did
they absorb substantial amounts of water and nutrients. In contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system,
transfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant. The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep into the
soil to reach sources of water also stabilizes plants by acting as a ballast or anchor. The majority of roots establish a symbiotic
relationship with fungi, forming mutualistic mycorrhizae, which benefit the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for
absorption of water, soil minerals, and nutrients.
Leaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili
A third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants. Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of
vascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency. Leaves capture more sunlight with their
increased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy, which is then used
to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive
cells of phloem tissue.

The stem of a horsetail is characterized by the presence of joints or nodes, hence the name Arthrophyta (arthro- = "joint"; -phyta
= "plant"). Leaves and branches come out as whorls from the evenly spaced joints. The needle-shaped leaves do not contribute
greatly to photosynthesis, the majority of which takes place in the green stem (Figure 25.19).

Phylum Monilophyta: Class Polypodiopsida (True Ferns)
With their large fronds, the truefernsare perhaps the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants. They are also
considered to be the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants.
More than 20,000 species of ferns live in environments ranging from the tropics to temperate forests. Although some species
survive in dry environments, most ferns are restricted to moist, shaded places. Ferns made their appearance in the fossil record
during the Devonian period (420 MYA) and expanded during the Carboniferous (360 to 300 MYA).
The dominant stage of the life cycle of a fern is the sporophyte, which consists of large compound leaves called fronds. Fronds
may be either finely divided or broadly lobed. Fronds fulfill a double role; they are photosynthetic organs that also carry
reproductive organs. The stem may be buried underground as a rhizome, from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water
and nutrients from the soil; or, they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns (Figure 25.21).Adventitiousorgans are those
that grow in unusual places, such as roots growing from the side of a stem.

The tip of a developing fern frond is rolled into a crozier, or fiddlehead (Figure 25.22). Fiddleheads unroll as the frond develops.
Figure25.22Fern fiddleheads. Croziers, or fiddleheads, are the tips of fern fronds. (credit a: modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit b:
modification of work by Myriam Feldman)
On the underside of each mature fern frond are groups of sporangia called sori (Figure 25.23a). Most ferns are homosporous.
Spores are produced by meiosis and are released into the air from the sporangium. Those that land on a suitable substrate
germinate and form a heart-shaped gametophyte, or prothallus, which is attached to the ground by thin filamentous rhizoids
(Figure 25.23b). Gametophytes produce both antheridia and archegonia. Like the sperm cells of other pterophytes, fern sperm
have multiple flagella and must swim to the archegonium, which releases a chemoattractant to guide them. The zygote develops
into a fern sporophyte, which emerges from the archegonium of the gametophyte. Maturation of antheridia and archegonia at
different times encourages cross-fertilization. The full life cycle of a fern is depicted inFigure 25.24.

CAREER CONNECTION
Landscape Designer
Looking at the ornamental arrangement of flower beds and fountains typical of the grounds of royal castles and historic houses
of Europe, it’s clear that the gardens’ creators knew about more than art and design. They were also familiar with the biology of
the plants they chose. Landscape design also has strong roots in the United States’ tradition. A prime example of early American
classical design is Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s private estate. Among his many interests, Jefferson maintained a strong
passion for botany. Landscape layout can encompass a small private space like a backyard garden, public gathering places such
as Central Park in New York City, or an entire city plan like Pierre L’Enfant’s design for Washington, DC.
A landscape designer will plan traditional public spaces—such as botanical gardens, parks, college campuses, gardens, and
larger developments—as well as natural areas and private gardens. The restoration of natural places encroached on by human
intervention, such as wetlands, also requires the expertise of a landscape designer.
With such an array of necessary skills, a landscape designer’s education should include a solid background in botany, soil
science, plant pathology, entomology, and horticulture. Coursework in architecture and design software is also required for the
completion of the degree. The successful design of a landscape rests on an extensive knowledge of plant growth requirements
such as light and shade, moisture levels, compatibility of different species, and susceptibility to pathogens and pests. Mosses
and ferns will thrive in a shaded area, where fountains provide moisture; cacti, on the other hand, would not fare well in that
environment. The future growth of individual plants must be taken into account, to avoid crowding and competition for light
and nutrients. The appearance of the space over time is also of concern. Shapes, colors, and biology must be balanced for a well-
maintained and sustainable green space. Art, architecture, and biology blend in a beautifully designed and implemented
landscape (Figure 25.25).

The Importance of Seedless Plants
Mosses and liverworts are often the first macroscopic organisms to colonize an area, both in a primary succession—where bare
land is settled for the first time by living organisms, or in a secondary succession—where soil remains intact after a catastrophic
event wipes out many existing species. Their spores are carried by the wind, birds, or insects. Once mosses and liverworts are
established, they provide food and shelter for other plant species. In a hostile environment, like the tundra where the soil is
frozen, bryophytes grow well because they do not have roots and can dry and rehydrate quickly once water is again available.
Mosses are at the base of the food chain in the tundra biome. Many species—from small herbivorous insects to musk oxen and
reindeer—depend on mosses for food. In turn, predators feed on the herbivores, which are the primary consumers. Some
reports indicate that bryophytes make the soil more amenable to colonization by other plants. Because they establish symbiotic
relationships with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, mosses replenish the soil with nitrogen.
By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists had observed that lichens and mosses were becoming increasingly rare in urban

source.
Evolution of Gymnosperms
The fossil plantElkinsia polymorpha, a "seed fern" from the Devonian period—about 400 million years ago—is considered the
earliest seed plant known to date. Seed ferns (Figure 26.3) produced their seeds along their branches, in structures called
cupules that enclosed and protected the ovule—the female gametophyte and associated tissues—which develops into a seed
upon fertilization. Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the
Carboniferous period.
Figure26.3Seed fern leaf. This fossilized leaf is fromGlossopteris, a seed fern that thrived during the Permian age (290–240 million years
ago). (credit: D.L. Schmidt, USGS)
Fossil records indicate the first gymnosperms (progymnosperms) most likely originated in the Paleozoic era, during the middle
Devonian period: about 390 million years ago. The previous Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods, were wet and dominated
by giant fern trees. But the following Permian period was dry, which gave a reproductive edge to seed plants, which are better
adapted to survive dry spells. The Ginkgoales, a group of gymnosperms with only one surviving species—theGinkgo
biloba—were the first gymnosperms to appear during the lower Jurassic. Gymnosperms expanded in the Mesozoic era (about
240 million years ago), supplanting ferns in the landscape, and reaching their greatest diversity during this time. The Jurassic
period was as much the age of the cycads (palm-tree-like gymnosperms) as the age of the dinosaurs. Ginkgoales and the more
familiar conifers also dotted the landscape. Although angiosperms (flowering plants) are the major form of plant life in most

Evolution of Angiosperms
The roughly 200 million years between the appearance of the gymnosperms and the flowering plants gives us some appreciation
for the evolutionary experimentation that ultimately produced flowers and fruit. Angiosperms (“seed in a vessel”) produce a
flower containing male and/or female reproductive structures. Fossil evidence (Figure 26.6) indicates that flowering plants first
appeared about 125 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous (late in the Mesozoic era), and were rapidly diversifying by about
100 million years ago in the Middle Cretaceous. Earlier traces of angiosperms are scarce. Fossilized pollen recovered from
Jurassic geological material has been attributed to angiosperms. A few early Cretaceous rocks show clear imprints of leaves
resembling angiosperm leaves. By the mid-Cretaceous, a staggering number of diverse flowering plants crowd the fossil record.
The same geological period is also marked by the appearance of many modern groups of insects, suggesting that pollinating
insects played a key role in the evolution of flowering plants.
New data in comparative genomics and paleobotany (the study of ancient plants) have shed some light on the evolution of
angiosperms. Although the angiosperms appeared after the gymnosperms, they are probably not derived from gymnosperm
ancestors. Instead, the angiosperms form a sister clade (a species and its descendents) that developed in parallel with the
gymnosperms. The two innovative structures of flowers and fruit represent an improved reproductive strategy that served to
protect the embryo, while increasing genetic variability and range. There is no current consensus on the origin of the
angiosperms. Paleobotanists debate whether angiosperms evolved from small woody bushes, or were related to the ancestors of
tropical grasses. Both views draw support from cladistics, and the so-called woodymagnoliid hypothesis—which proposes that
the early ancestors of angiosperms were shrubs like modern magnolia—also offers molecular biological evidence.
The most primitive living angiosperm is considered to beAmborella trichopoda, a small plant native to the rainforest of New
Caledonia, an island in the South Pacific. Analysis of the genome ofA. trichopodahas shown that it is related to all existing
flowering plants and belongs to the oldest confirmed branch of the angiosperm family tree. The nuclear genome shows evidence
of an ancient whole-genome duplication. The mitochondrial genome is large and multichromosomal, containing elements from
the mitochondrial genomes of several other species, including algae and a moss. A few other angiosperm groups, called basal
angiosperms, are viewed as having ancestral traits because they branched off early from the phylogenetic tree. Most modern
angiosperms are classified as either monocots or eudicots, based on the structure of their leaves and embryos. Basal

Figure26.7Plant phylogeny. This phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships of plants.
Phylogenetic trees have been built to describe the relationships between species since the first sketch of a tree that appeared in
Darwin'sOrigin of Species. Traditional methods involve comparison of homologous anatomical structures and embryonic
development, assuming that closely related organisms share anatomical features that emerge during embryo development.
Some traits that disappear in the adult are present in the embryo; for example, an early human embryo has a postanal tail, as do
all members of the Phylum Chordata. The study of fossil records shows the intermediate stages that link an ancestral form to its
descendants. However, many of the approaches to classification based on the fossil record alone are imprecise and lend
themselves to multiple interpretations. As the tools of molecular biology and computational analysis have been developed and
perfected in recent years, a new generation of tree-building methods has taken shape. The key assumption is that genes for
essential proteins or RNA structures, such as the ribosomal RNAs, are inherently conserved because mutations (changes in the
DNA sequence) could possibly compromise the survival of the organism. DNA from minute samples of living organisms or
fossils can be amplified bypolymerase chain reaction(PCR) and sequenced, targeting the regions of the genome that are most
likely to be conserved between species. The genes encoding the 18S ribosomal RNA from the small subunit and plastid genes are
frequently chosen for DNA alignment analysis.
Once the sequences of interest are obtained, they are compared with existing sequences in databases such as GenBank, which is
maintained by The National Center for Biotechnology Information. A number of computational tools are available to align and
analyze sequences. Sophisticated computer analysis programs determine the percentage of sequence identity or homology.
Sequence homology can be used to estimate the evolutionary distance between two DNA sequences and reflect the time elapsed
since the genes separated from a common ancestor. Molecular analysis has revolutionized phylogenetic trees. In some cases,
prior results from morphological studies have been confirmed: for example, confirmingAmborella trichopodaas the most
primitive angiosperm known. However, some groups and relationships have been rearranged as a result of DNA analysis.

Gymnosperms
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the type of seeds produced by gymnosperms, as well as other characteristics of gymnosperms
• Identify the geological era dominated by the gymnosperms and describe the conditions to which they were
adapted
• List the four groups of modern-day gymnosperms and provide examples of each
• Describe the life cycle of a typical gymnosperm
Gymnosperms, meaning “naked seeds,” are a diverse group of seed plants. According to the "anthophyte" hypothesis, the
angiosperms are a sister group of one group of gymnosperms (the Gnetales), which makes the gymnosperms a paraphyletic
group. Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all descendants of a single common ancestor are included in the group.
However , the "netifer" hypothesis suggests that the gnetophytes are sister to the conifers, making the gymnosperms
monophyletic and sister to the angiosperms. Further molecular and anatomical studies may clarify these relationships.
Characteristics of the gymnosperms include naked seeds, separate female and male gamtophytes, pollen cones and ovulate
cones, pollination by wind and insects, and tracheids (which transport water and solutes in the vascular system).
Gymnosperm seeds are not enclosed in an ovary; rather, they are only partially sheltered by modified leaves calledsporophylls.
You may recall the termstrobilus(plural = strobili) describes a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk, as seen
in pine cones. Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation. The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds
the megasporangium, and later, the embryo, is called theintegument.
Gymnosperms were the dominant phylum in the Mesozoic era. They are adapted to live where fresh water is scarce during part
of the year, or in the nitrogen-poor soil of a bog. Therefore, they are still the prominent phylum in the coniferous biome ortaiga,
where the evergreen conifers have a selective advantage in cold and dry weather. Evergreen conifers continue low levels of
photosynthesis during the cold months, and are ready to take advantage of the first sunny days of spring. One disadvantage is
that conifers are more susceptible than deciduous trees to leaf infestations because most conifers do not lose their leaves all at
once. They cannot, therefore, shed parasites and restart with a fresh supply of leaves in spring.
The life cycle of a gymnosperm involves alternation of generations, with a dominant sporophyte in which reduced male and
female gametophytes reside. All gymnosperms are heterosporous. The male and female reproductive organs can form in cones
or strobili. Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant, described asmonoecious(“one home” or
bisexual), or on separate plants, referred to asdioecious(“two homes” or unisexual) plants. The life cycle of a conifer will serve as
our example of reproduction in gymnosperms.
Life Cycle of a Conifer
Pine trees are conifers (coniferous = cone bearing) and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte.
Therefore, they are monoecious plants. Like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of
spores (male microspores and female megaspores). Male and female spores develop in different strobili, with small male cones
and larger female cones. In the male cones, or staminate cones, themicrosporocytesundergo meiosis and the resultant haploid
microspores give rise to male gametophytes or “pollen grains” by mitosis. Each pollen grain consists of just a few haploid cells
enclosed in a tough wall reinforced with sporopollenin. In the spring, large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by
the wind. Some gametophytes will land on a female cone. Pollination is defined as the initiation of pollen tube growth. The
pollen tube develops slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain produces two haploid sperm or generative nuclei by
mitosis. At fertilization, one of the haploid sperm nuclei will unite with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell.
Female cones, orovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale. Each ovule has a narrow passage that opens near the base of the
sporophyll. This passage is the micropyle, through which a pollen tube will later grow. One megaspore mother cell, or
megasporocyte, undergoes meiosis in each ovule. Three of the four cells break down; only a single surviving cell will develop into
a female multicellular gametophyte, which encloses archegonia (an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single
large egg). As the female gametophyte begins to develop, a sticky pollination drop traps windblown pollen grains near the
opening of the micropyle. A pollen tube is formed and grows toward the developing gametophyte. One of the generative or
sperm nuclei from the pollen tube will enter the egg and fuse with the egg nucleus as the egg matures. Upon fertilization, the
diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant. Although several eggs
may be formed and even fertilized, there is usually a single surviving embryo in each ovule. Fertilization and seed development
is a long process in pine trees: it may take up to two years after pollination. The seed that is formed contains three generations of

## Section 459.2
• Angiosperms 681
Myriam Feldman)
The success of angiosperms is due to two novel reproductive structures: flowers and fruits. The function of the flower is to
ensure pollination, often by arthropods, as well as to protect a developing embryo. The colors and patterns on flowers offer
specific signals to many pollinating insects or birds and bats that have coevolved with them. For example, some patterns are
visible only in the ultraviolet range of light, which can be seen by arthropod pollinators. For some pollinators, flowers advertise
themselves as a reliable source of nectar. Flower scent also helps to select its pollinators. Sweet scents tend to attract bees and
butterflies and moths, but some flies and beetles might prefer scents that signal fermentation or putrefaction. Flowers also
provide protection for the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle. The function of the fruit is seed protection and
dispersal. Different fruit structures or tissues on fruit—such as sweet flesh, wings, parachutes, or spines that grab—reflect the
dispersal strategies that help spread seeds.
Flowers
Flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central receptacle. Although they vary greatly in appearance,
virtually all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle typically attaches the flower
to the plant proper. A whorl ofsepals(collectively called thecalyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the
unopened floral bud. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in
lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical.Petals, collectively thecorolla, are located
inside the whorl of sepals and may display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Sepals and petals together form theperianth. The
sexual organs, thefemale gynoeciumandmale androeciumare located at the center of the flower. Typically, the sepals, petals,
and stamens are attached to the receptacle at the base of the gynoecium, but the gynoecium may also be located deeper in the
receptacle, with the other floral structures attached above it.
As illustrated inFigure 26.14, the innermost part of a perfect flower is thegynoecium, the location in the flower where the eggs
will form. The female reproductive unit consists of one or more carpels, each of which has a stigma, style, and ovary. Thestigma
is the location where the pollen is deposited either by wind or a pollinating arthropod. The sticky surface of the stigma traps
pollen grains, and thestyleis a connecting structure through which the pollen tube will grow to reach the ovary. Theovary
houses one or more ovules, each of which will ultimately develop into aseed. Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may
be singular, multiple, or fused. (Multiple fused carpels comprise apistil.) Theandroecium, or male reproductive region is
composed of multiple stamens surrounding the central carpel.Stamensare composed of a thin stalk called afilamentand a sac-
like structure called theanther. The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop
into haploid pollen grains, or male gametophytes.

Question: If a flower lacked a megasporangium, what type of gamete would not form? If the flower lacked a microsporangium,
what type of gamete would not form?
The ovule, sheltered within the ovary of the carpel, contains the megasporangium protected by two layers of integuments and
the ovary wall. Within each megasporangium, a diploid megasporocyte undergoes meiosis, generating four haploid
megaspores—three small and one large. Only the large megaspore survives; it divides mitotically three times to produce eight
nuclei distributed among the seven cells of the female gametophyte or embryo sac. Three of these cells are located at each pole of
the embryo sac. The three cells at one pole become the egg and twosynergids. The three cells at the opposite pole become
antipodal cells. The center cell contains the remaining two nuclei (polar nuclei). This cell will eventually produce the endosperm
of the seed. The mature embryo sac then contains one egg cell, two synergids or “helper” cells, three antipodal cells (which
eventually degenerate), and a central cell with two polar nuclei. When a pollen grain reaches the stigma, a pollen tube extends
from the grain, grows down the style, and enters through the micropyle: an opening in the integuments of the ovule. The two
sperm are deposited in the embryo sac.
A double fertilization event then occurs. One sperm and the egg combine, forming a diploid zygote—the future embryo. The
other sperm fuses with the polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that will develop into theendosperm—the tissue that serves as a
food reserve for the developing embryo. The zygote develops into an embryo with aradicle, or small root, and one (monocot) or

hypanthium. Some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single flower, such as the raspberry. Other fruits, such as the
pineapple, form from clusters of flowers. Additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds. Regardless of how
they are formed, fruits are an agent of seed dispersal. The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal.
Wind carries the light dry fruits of trees and dandelions. Water transports floating coconuts. Some fruits attract herbivores with
their color or scent, or as food. Once eaten, tough, undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivore’s feces (endozoochory).
Other fruits have burrs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals (epizoochory).
Diversity of Angiosperms
Angiosperms are classified in a single phylum: theAnthophyta. Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which
as you may recall means that they originated from a single ancestor. Within the angiosperms are three major groups: basal
angiosperms, monocots, and dicots. Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the
separation of the monocots and eudicots, because they exhibit traits from both groups. They are categorized separately in most
classification schemes. The basal angiosperms includeAmborella, water lilies, the Magnoliids (magnolia trees, laurels, and spice
peppers), and a group called the Austrobaileyales, which includes the star anise. The monocots and dicots are differentiated on
the basis of the structure of the cotyledons, pollen grains, and other structures. Monocots include grasses and lilies, and the
dicots form a multi-branched group that includes (among many others) roses, cabbages, sunflowers, and mints.
Basal Angiosperms
The Magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias, laurels, and peppers. Magnolias are tall trees bearing dark, shiny leaves, and
large, fragrant flowers with many parts, and are considered archaic (Figure 26.17). In the outer whorl of the magnolia flower the
sepals and petals are undifferentiated and are collectively called tepals. The reproductive parts are arranged in a spiral around a
cone-shaped receptacle, with the carpels located above the stamens (Figure 26.17). The aggregate fruit, with one seed formed
from each carpel, is seen inFigure 26.18d. Laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. TheLaurales
grow mostly in warmer climates and are small trees and shrubs. Familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel, cinnamon,
spice bush (Figure 26.18a), and avocado tree.

Eudicots
Eudicots, or truedicots, are characterized by the presence of two cotyledons in the developing shoot. Veins form a network in
leaves, and flower parts come in four, five, or many whorls. Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem; in monocots, vascular tissue
is scattered in the stem. Eudicots can beherbaceous(not woody), or produce woody tissues. Most eudicots produce pollen that
is trisulcate or triporate, with three furrows or pores. The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the
embryonic radicle. Eudicots comprise two-thirds of all flowering plants. The major differences between monocots and eudicots
are summarized inTable 26.1. However, some species may exhibit characteristics usually associated with the other group, so
identification of a plant as a monocot or a eudicot is not always straightforward.

The Role of Seed Plants
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how angiosperm diversity is due, in part, to multiple complex interactions with animals
• Describe ways in which pollination occurs
• Discuss the roles that plants play in ecosystems and how deforestation threatens plant biodiversity
Without seed plants, life as we know it would not be possible. Plants play a key role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems
through the stabilization of soils, cycling of carbon, and climate moderation. Large tropical forests release oxygen and act as
carbon dioxide “sinks.” Seed plants provide shelter to many life forms, as well as food for herbivores, thereby indirectly feeding
carnivores. Plant secondary metabolites are used for medicinal purposes and industrial production. Virtually all animal life is
dependent on plants for survival.
Animals and Plants: Herbivory
Coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support, especially because
both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic. Many authors have attributed the
diversity of plants and insects to both pollination andherbivory, or the consumption of plants by insects and other animals.
Herbivory is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination. Coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is easily
and commonly observed in nature. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry
animals (although mimicry has been used to entice pollinators). A sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores. To
“combat” herbivores, some plant seeds—such as acorn and unripened persimmon—are high in alkaloids and therefore unsavory
to some animals. Other plants are protected by bark, although some animals developed specialized mouth pieces to tear and
chew vegetal material. Spines and thorns (Figure 26.20) deter most animals, except for mammals with thick fur, and some birds
have specialized beaks to get past such defenses.
Figure26.20Plant defenses. (a) Spines and (b) thorns are examples of plant defenses. (credit a: modification of work by Jon Sullivan;
credit b: modification of work by I. Sáček, Sr.)
Herbivory has been exploited by seed plants for their own benefit. The dispersal of fruits by herbivorous animals is a striking
example of mutualistic relationships. The plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in return for spreading the
plant’s genetic material to a wider area.
An extreme example of coevolution (discovered by Daniel Janzen) between an animal and a plant is exemplified by Mexican
acacia trees and their attendant acacia antsPseudomyrmexspp. (this is termedmyrmecophytism). The trees support the ants
with shelter and food: The ants nest in the hollows of large thorns produced by the tree and feed on sugary secretions produced
at the ends of the leaves. The sugar pellets also help to keep the ants from interfering with insect pollinators. In return, ants
discourage herbivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates, by stinging and attacking leaf-eaters and insects ovipositing on the
plants. The ants also help to remove potential plant pathogens, such as fungal growths. Another case of insect-plant coevolution
is found in bracken fern (Pteridium aquinilum), whose subspecies are found throughout the world. Bracken ferns produce a
number of “secondary plant compounds” in their adult fronds that serve as defensive compounds against nonadapted insect
attack (these compounds include cyanogenic glucosides, tannins, and phenolics). However, during the “fiddlehead” or crozier
stage, bracken secretes nutritious sugary and proteinaceous compounds from special “nectaries” that attract ants and even
species of jumping spiders, all of which defend the plant’s croziers until they are fully unfolded. These opportunistic groups of
protective arthropods greatly reduce the damage that otherwise would occur during the early stages of growth.

Animals and Plants: Pollination
Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous.Grassesare a successful group of flowering
plants that are wind pollinated. They produce large amounts of powdery pollen carried over large distances by the wind. Some
large trees such as oaks, maples, and birches are also wind pollinated.
LINK TO LEARNING
Explore thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/pollinators2)for additional information on pollinators.
More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals forpollination(technically the transfer of pollen from the anther to
the stigma). Consequently, plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators. With over 200,000 different plants
dependent on animal pollination, the plant needs to advertise to its pollinators with some specificity. The specificity of
specialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising. It is possible, for example, to determine the general type
of pollinators favored by a plant by observing the flower’s physical characteristics. Many bird or insect-pollinated flowers secrete
nectar, which is a sugary liquid. They also produce both fertile pollen, for reproduction, and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for
birds and insects. Many butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light, and flowers that attract these pollinators usually display
a pattern of ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flower's center. In this manner, pollinating insects collect
nectar while at the same time are dusted with pollen (Figure 26.21). Large, red flowers with little smell and a long funnel shape
are preferred by hummingbirds, who have good color perception, a poor sense of smell, and need a strong perch. White flowers
that open at night attract moths. Other animals—such as bats, lemurs, and lizards—can also act as pollinating agents. Any
disruption to these interactions, such as the disappearance of bees, for example as a consequence of colony collapse disorders,
can lead to disaster for agricultural industries that depend heavily on pollinated crops.

SCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION
Testing Attraction of Flies by Rotting Flesh Smell
Question: Will flowers that offer cues to bees attract carrion flies if sprayed with compounds that smell like rotten flesh?
Background: Visitation of flowers by pollinating flies is a function mostly of smell. Flies are attracted by rotting flesh and
carrions. The putrid odor seems to be the major attractant. The polyamines putrescine and cadaverine, which are the products of
protein breakdown after animal death, are the source of the pungent smell of decaying meat. Some plants strategically attract
flies by synthesizing polyamines similar to those generated by decaying flesh and thereby attract carrion flies.
Flies seek out dead animals because they normally lay their eggs on them and their maggots feed on the decaying flesh.
Interestingly, time of death can be determined by a forensic entomologist based on the stages and type of maggots recovered
from cadavers.

vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Sugar, to sweeten dishes, is produced from the monocot sugarcane and the eudicot sugar beet.
Drinks are made from infusions of tea leaves, chamomile flowers, crushed coffee beans, or powdered cocoa beans. Spices come
from many different plant parts: saffron and cloves are stamens and buds, black pepper and vanilla are seeds, the bark of a bush
in theLauralesfamily supplies cinnamon, and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit, such as the
pungent red chili pepper. The volatile oils of a number of flowers and bark provide the scent of perfumes.
Additionally, no discussion of seed plant contribution to human diet would be complete without the mention of alcohol.
Fermentation of plant-derived sugars and starches is used to produce alcoholic beverages in all societies. In some cases, the
beverages are derived from the fermentation of sugars from fruit, as with wines and, in other cases, from the fermentation of
carbohydrates derived from seeds, as with beers. The sharing of foods and beverages also contributes to human social ritual.
Seed plants have many other uses, including providing wood as a source of timber for construction, fuel, and material to build
furniture. Most paper is derived from the pulp of coniferous trees. Fibers of seed plants such as cotton, flax, and hemp are
woven into cloth. Textile dyes, such as indigo, were mostly of plant origin until the advent of synthetic chemical dyes.
Lastly, it is more difficult to quantify the benefits of ornamental seed plants. These grace private and public spaces, adding
beauty and serenity to human lives and inspiring painters and poets alike.

plant specimens studied and collected, but also the stories, recipes, and traditions that are linked to them. For ethnobotanists,
plants are not viewed solely as biological organisms to be studied in a laboratory, but as an integral part of human culture. The
convergence of molecular biology, anthropology, and ecology make the field of ethnobotany a truly multidisciplinary science.
Biodiversity of Plants
Biodiversity ensures a resource for new food crops and medicines. Plant life balances ecosystems, protects watersheds,
mitigates erosion, moderates our climate, and provides shelter for many animal species. Threats to plant diversity, however,
come from many sources. The explosion of the human population, especially in tropical countries where birth rates are highest
and economic development is in full swing, is leading to devastating human encroachment into forested areas. To feed the
growing population, humans need to obtain arable land, so there has been and continues to be massive clearing of trees. The
need for more energy to power larger cities and economic growth therein leads to the construction of dams, the consequent
flooding of ecosystems, and increased emissions of pollutants. Other threats to tropical forests come from poachers, who log
trees for their precious wood. Ebony and Brazilian rosewood, both on the endangered list, are examples of tree species driven
almost to extinction by indiscriminate logging. This unfortunate practice continues unabated today largely due to lack of
population control and political willpower.
The number of plant species becoming extinct is increasing at an alarming rate. Because ecosystems are in a delicate balance,
and seed plants maintain close symbiotic relationships with animals—whether predators or pollinators—the disappearance of a
single plant can lead to the extinction of connected animal species. A real and pressing issue is that many plant species have not
yet been catalogued, and so their place in the ecosystem is unknown. These unknown species are threatened by logging, habitat
destruction, and loss of pollinators. They may become extinct before we have the chance to begin to understand the possible
impacts from their disappearance. Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action, from preserving heirloom seeds
to barcoding species.Heirloom seedscome from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations, as opposed to the
seeds used for large-scale agricultural production.Barcodingis a technique in which one or more short gene sequences, taken
from a well-characterized portion of DNA found in most genomes, are used to identify a species through DNA analysis.

tissues in true animals are responsible for carrying out specific functions for the organism. This differentiation and
specialization of tissues is part of what allows for such incredible animal diversity.
Just as there are multiple ways to be a eukaryote, there are multiple ways to be a multicellular animal. The animal kingdom is
currently divided into five monophyletic clades: Parazoa or Porifera (sponges), Placozoa (tiny parasitic creatures that resemble
multicellular amoebae), Cnidaria (jellyfish and their relatives), Ctenophora (the comb jellies), and Bilateria (all other animals).
The Placozoa ("flat animal") and Parazoa (“beside animal”) do not have specialized tissues derived from germ layers of the
embryo; although they do possess specialized cells that actfunctionallylike tissues. The Placozoa have only four cell types, while
the sponges have nearly two dozen. The three other clades do include animals with specialized tissues derived from the germ
layers of the embryo. In spite of their superficial similarity to Cnidarian medusae, recent molecular studies indicate that the
Ctenophores are only distantly related to the Cnidarians, which together with the Bilateria constitute the Eumetazoa ("true
animals"). When we think of animals, we usually think of Eumetazoa, since most animals fall into this category.

Animal Reproduction and Development
Most animals are diploid organisms, meaning that their body (somatic) cells are diploid and haploid reproductive (gamete) cells
are produced through meiosis. Some exceptions exist: for example, in bees, wasps, and ants, the male is haploid because it
develops from unfertilized eggs. Most animals undergo sexual reproduction. However, a few groups, such as cnidarians,
flatworms, and roundworms, may also undergo asexual reproduction, in which offspring originate from part of the parental
body.
Processes of Animal Reproduction and Embryonic Development
During sexual reproduction, the haploid gametes of the male and female individuals of a species combine in a process called
fertilization. Typically, both male and female gametes are required: the small, motile male sperm fertilizes the typically much
larger, sessile female egg. This process produces a diploid fertilized egg called a zygote.
Some animal species—including sea stars and sea anemones—are capable of asexual reproduction. The most common forms of
asexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals includebuddingandfragmentation, where part of a parent individual can
separate and grow into a new individual. This type of asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring, which
would appear to be disadvantageous from the perspective of evolutionary adaptability, simply because of the potential buildup
of deleterious mutations.
In contrast, a form of uniparental reproduction found in some insects and a few vertebrates is called parthenogenesis (or “virgin
beginning”). In this case, progeny develop from a gamete, but without fertilization. Because of the nutrients stored in eggs, only
females produce parthenogenetic offspring. In some insects, unfertilized eggs develop into new male offspring. This type of sex
determination is called haplodiploidy, since females are diploid (with both maternal and paternal chromosomes) and males are
haploid (with only maternal chromosomes). A few vertebrates, e.g., some fish, turkeys, rattlesnakes, and whiptail lizards, are
also capable of parthenogenesis. In the case of turkeys and rattlesnakes, parthenogenetically reproducing females also produce
only male offspring, but not because the males are haploid. In birds and rattlesnakes, the female is the heterogametic (ZW) sex,
so the only surviving progeny of post-meiotic parthenogenesis would be ZZ males. In the whiptail lizards, on the other hand,
only female progeny are produced by parthenogenesis. These animals may not be identical to their parent, although they have
only maternal chromosomes. However, for animals that are limited in their access to mates, uniparental reproduction can
ensure genetic propagation.
In animals, the zygote progresses through a series of developmental stages, during which primarygerm layers(ectoderm,
endoderm, and mesoderm) are established and reorganize to form an embryo. During this process, animal tissues begin to
specialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology.
Animal development begins withcleavage, a series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote (Figure 27.3). Cleavage differs from
somatic cell division in that the egg is subdivided by successive cleavages into smaller and smaller cells, withnoactual cell
growth. The cells resulting from subdivision of the material of the egg in this way are calledblastomeres. Three cell divisions
transform the single-celled zygote into an eight-celled structure. After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells,
a solid morula is formed, followed by a hollow structure called ablastula. The blastula is hollow only in invertebrates whose eggs

The Role of Homeobox (Hox) Genes in Animal Development
Since the early nineteenth century, scientists have observed that many animals, from the very simple to the complex, shared
similar embryonic morphology and development. Surprisingly, a human embryo and a frog embryo, at a certain stage of
embryonic development, look remarkably alike! For a long time, scientists did not understand why so many animal species
looked similar during embryonic development but were very different as adults. They wondered what dictated the
developmental direction that a fly, mouse, frog, or human embryo would take. Near the end of the twentieth century, a
particular class of genes was discovered that had this very job. These genes that determine animal structure are called “homeotic
genes,” and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes. Genes with homeoboxes encode protein transcription factors. One
group of animal genes containing homeobox sequences is specifically referred to asHoxgenes. This cluster of genes is
responsible for determining the general body plan, such as the number of body segments of an animal, the number and
placement of appendages, and animal head-tail directionality. The firstHoxgenes to be sequenced were those from the fruit fly
(Drosophila melanogaster). A singleHoxmutation in the fruit fly can result in an extra pair of wings or even legs growing from
the head in place of antennae (this is because antennae and legs are embryologic homologous structures and their appearance as
antennae or legs is dictated by their origination within specific body segments of the head and thorax during development).
Now,Hoxgenes are known from virtually all other animals as well.
While there are a great many genes that play roles in the morphological development of an animal, including other homeobox-
containing genes, what makesHoxgenes so powerful is that they serve as “master control genes” that can turn on or off large
numbers of other genes.Hoxgenes do this by encoding transcription factors that control the expression of numerous other
genes.Hoxgenes are homologous across the animal kingdom, that is, the genetic sequences ofHoxgenes and their positions on

Features Used to Classify Animals
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain the differences in animal body plans that support basic animal classification
• Compare and contrast the embryonic development of protostomes and deuterostomes
Scientists have developed a classification scheme that categorizes all members of the animal kingdom, although there are
exceptions to most “rules” governing animal classification (Figure 27.6). Animals have been traditionally classified according to
two characteristics: body plan and developmental pathway. The major feature of the body plan is its symmetry: how the body
parts are distributed along the major body axis. Symmetrical animals can be divided into roughly equivalent halves along at
least one axis. Developmental characteristics include the number of germ tissue layers formed during development, the origin
of the mouth and anus, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development,
such as larval types or whether or not periods of growth are interspersed with molting.

and Porifera are both considered to be basal because of the absence of Hox genes in this group, but how they are related to the
“Parahoxozoa” (Placozoa + Eumetazoa) or to each other, continues to be a matter of debate.
Which of the following statements is false?
a. Eumetazoans have specialized tissues and parazoans don’t.
b. Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa are both Bilataria.
c. Acoela and Cnidaria both possess radial symmetry.
d. Arthropods are more closely related to nematodes than they are to annelids.
Animal Characterization Based on Body Symmetry
At a very basic level of classification, true animals can be largely divided into three groups based on the type of symmetry of
their body plan: radially symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, and asymmetrical. Asymmetry is seen in two modern clades, the
Parazoa (Figure 27.7a) and Placozoa. (Although we should note that the ancestral fossils of the Parazoa apparently exhibited
bilateral symmetry.) One clade, the Cnidaria (Figure 27.7b,c), exhibits radial or biradial symmetry: Ctenophores have rotational
symmetry (Figure 27.7e). Bilateral symmetry is seen in the largest of the clades, the Bilateria (Figure 27.7d); however the
Echinodermata are bilateral as larvae and metamorphose secondarily into radial adults. All types of symmetry are well suited to

Animals in the phylum Echinodermata (such as sea stars, sand dollars, and sea urchins) display modified radial symmetry as
adults, but as we have noted, their larval stages (such as the bipinnaria) initially exhibit bilateral symmetry until they
metamorphose in animals with radial symmetry (this is termed secondary radial symmetry). Echinoderms evolved from
bilaterally symmetrical animals; thus, they are classified as bilaterally symmetrical.

Animal Characterization Based on Features of Embryological Development
Most animal species undergo a separation of tissues into germ layers during embryonic development. Recall that these germ
layers are formed duringgastrulation, and that each germ layer typically gives rise to specific types of embryonic tissues and
organs. Animals develop either two or three embryonic germ layers (Figure 27.9). The animals that display radial, biradial, or
rotational symmetry develop two germ layers, an inner layer (endodermormesendoderm) and an outer layer (ectoderm). These
animals are calleddiploblasts, and have a nonliving middle layer between the endoderm and ectoderm (although individual cells
may be distributed through this middle layer, there is nocoherentthird layer of tissue). The four clades considered to be
diploblastic have different levels of complexity and different developmental pathways, although there is little information about
development in Placozoa. More complex animals (usually those with bilateral symmetry) develop three tissue layers: an inner
layer (endoderm), an outer layer (ectoderm), and a middle layer (mesoderm). Animals with three tissue layers are called
triploblasts.

coelom lined partly by mesoderm and partly by endoderm. Although still functionally a coelom, these are considered “false”
coeloms, and so we call these animalspseudocoelomates. The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) is an example of a
pseudocoelomate. True coelomates can be further characterized based on other features of their early embryological
development.
Figure27.10Body cavities. Triploblasts may be (a) acoelomates, (b) eucoelomates, or (c) pseudocoelomates. Acoelomates have no body
cavity. Eucoelomates have a body cavity within the mesoderm, called a coelom, in which both the gut and the body wall are lined with
mesoderm. Pseudocoelomates also have a body cavity, but only the body wall is lined with mesoderm. (credit a: modification of work by
Jan Derk; credit b: modification of work by NOAA; credit c: modification of work by USDA, ARS)
Embryonic Development of the Mouth
Bilaterally symmetrical, tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in the origin of
the mouth. When the primitive gut forms, the opening that first connects the gut cavity to the outside of the embryo is called
the blastopore. Most animals have openings at both ends of the gut: mouth at one end and anus at the other. One of these
openings will develop at or near the site of theblastopore. InProtostomes("mouth first"), the mouth develops at the blastopore
(Figure 27.11). InDeuterostomes("mouth second"), the mouth develops at the other end of the gut (Figure 27.11) and the anus
develops at the site of the blastopore. Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids. Deuterostomes include more
complex animals such as chordates but also some “simple” animals such as echinoderms. Recent evidence has challenged this
simple view of the relationship between the location of the blastopore and the formation of the mouth, however, and the theory
remains under debate. Nevertheless, these details of mouth and anus formation reflectgeneraldifferences in the organization
of protostome and deuterostome embryos, which are also expressed in other developmental features.
One of these differences between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation, beginning from the
gastrula stage. Since body cavity formation tends to accompany the formation of the mesoderm, the mesoderm of protostomes
and deuterostomes forms differently. The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process calledschizocoely. The
mesoderm in these organisms is usually the product of specificblastomeres, which migrate into the interior of the embryo and
form two clumps of mesodermal tissue. Within each clump, cavities develop and merge to form the hollow opening of the
coelom. Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process calledenterocoely. Here, the mesoderm develops as
pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue. These pouches eventually fuse and expand to fill the space between the
gut and the body wall, giving rise to the coelom.
Another difference in organization of protostome and deuterostome embryos is expressed during cleavage. Protostomes
undergospiral cleavage, meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated, and thus misaligned, with respect to the

mesenchyme fills the space between the gut and the body wall. Although two layers of muscle are found just under the
epidermis, there is no muscle or other mesodermal tissue around the gut. Flatworms rely on passive diffusion for nutrient
transport across their body.
Inpseudocoelomates, there is a body cavity between the gut and the body wall, but only the body wall has mesodermal tissue. In
these animals, the mesoderm forms, but does not develop cavities within it. Major pseudocoelomate phyla are the rotifers and
nematodes. Animals that have a true coelom are calledeucoelomates; all vertebrates, as well as molluscs, annelids, arthropods,
and echinoderms, are eucoelomates. The coelom develops within the mesoderm during embryogenesis. Of the major bilaterian
phyla, the molluscs, annelids, and arthropods areschizocoels, in which the mesoderm splits to form the body cavity, while the
echinoderms and chordates areenterocoels, in which the mesoderm forms as two or more buds off of the gut. These buds
separate from the gut and coalesce to form the body cavity. In the vertebrates, mammals have a subdivided body cavity, with the
thoracic cavity separated from the abdominal cavity. The pseudocoelomates may have had eucoelomate ancestors and may have
lost their ability to form a complete coelom through genetic mutations. Thus, this step in early embryogenesis—the formation of
the coelom—has had a large evolutionary impact on the various species of the animal kingdom.

## Section 477.2
Animal Phylogeny
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Interpret the metazoan phylogenetic tree
• Describe the types of data that scientists use to construct and revise animal phylogeny
• List some of the relationships within the modern phylogenetic tree that have been discovered as a result of
modern molecular data
Biologists strive to understand the evolutionary history and relationships of members of the animal kingdom, and all of life, for
that matter. The study ofphylogeny(the branching sequence of evolution) aims to determine the evolutionary relationships
between phyla. Currently, most biologists divide the animal kingdom into 35 to 40 phyla. Scientists develop phylogenetic trees,
which serve ashypothesesabout which species have evolved from which ancestors.
Recall that until recently, only morphological characteristics and the fossil record were used to determine phylogenetic
relationships among animals. Scientific understanding of the distinctions and hierarchies between anatomical characteristics
provided much of this knowledge. Used alone, however, this information can be misleading. Morphological characteristics (such
as skin color, body shape, etc.) may evolve multiple times, and independently, through evolutionary history. Analogous
characteristics may appear similar between animals, but their underlying evolution may be very different. With the
advancement ofmolecular technologies, modern phylogenetics is now informed by genetic and molecular analyses, in addition
to traditional morphological and fossil data. With a growing understanding of genetics, the animal evolutionary tree has
changed substantially and continues to change as new DNA and RNA analyses are performed on additional animal species.
Constructing an Animal Phylogenetic Tree
The current understanding of evolutionary relationships among animal, orMetazoa, phyla begins with the distinction between
animals withtrue differentiated tissues, calledEumetazoa, and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues, such
as the sponges (Porifera) and the Placozoa. Similarities between the feeding cells of sponges (choanocytes) and choanoflagellate
protists (Figure 27.12) have been used to suggest that Metazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembled the
moderncolonial choanoflagellates.

ecdysozoan clade was formed. Due to morphological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were
once thought to be closely related. However, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to
nematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other
phyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. These two clades now make up the protostomes.
Another change to former phylogenetic groupings because of modern molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely
new phylum of worm called Acoelomorpha. These acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes
because of their similar “flatworm” morphology. However, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and
originally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. More recent research
into the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested that the acoels are more closely related to
deuterostomes. The placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data,
their true phylogeny will be determined.
Another example of phylogenetic reorganization involves the identification of the Ctenophora as the basal clade of the animal
kingdom. Ctenophora, or comb jellies, were once considered to be a sister group of the Cnidaria, and the sponges (Porifera)
were placed as the basal animal group, sister to other animals. The presence of nerve and muscle cells in both the Ctenophores
and the Cnidaria and their absence in the Porifera strengthened this view of the relationships among simple animal forms.
However, recent molecular analysis has shown that many of the genes that support neural development in other animals are
absent from the Ctenophore genome. The muscle cells are restricted to the mouth and tentacles and are derived from cells in the
mesoglea. The mitochondrial genome of the Ctenophores is small and lacks many genes found in other animal mitochondrial
genomes. These features plus the absence ofHoxgenes from the Ctenophores have been used to argue that the Ctenophores
should be considered basal or as a sister group of the Porifera, and that the evolution of specialized nerve and muscle tissue may
have occurred more than once in the history of animal life. Although Ctenophores have been shown as basal to other animals in
the phylogeny presented in

The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the features that characterized the earliest animals and approximately when they appeared on
earth
• Explain the significance of the Cambrian period for animal evolution and the changes in animal diversity that
took place during that time
• Describe some of the unresolved questions surrounding the Cambrian explosion
• Discuss the implications of mass animal extinctions that have occurred in evolutionary history
Many questions regarding the origins and evolutionary history of the animal kingdom continue to be researched and debated,
as new fossil and molecular evidence change prevailing theories. Some of these questions include the following: How long have
animals existed on Earth? What were the earliest members of the animal kingdom, and what organism was their common
ancestor? While animal diversity increased during the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era, 530 million years ago, modern
fossil evidence suggests that primitive animal species existed much earlier.
Pre-Cambrian Animal Life
The time before the Cambrian period is known as theEdiacaran Period(from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years
ago), the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era (Figure 27.14). Ediacaran fossils were first found in the
Ediacaran hills of Southern Australia. There are no living representatives of these species, which have left impressions that look
like those of feathers or coins (Figure 27.15). It is believed that early animal life, termedEdiacaran biota, evolved from protists at
this time.

One of the most dominant species during the Cambrian period was the trilobite, an arthropod that was among the first animals
to exhibit a sense of vision (Figure 27.17a,b,c,d). Trilobites were somewhat similar to modern horseshoe crabs. Thousands of
different species have been identified in fossil sediments of the Cambrian period; not a single species survives today.

development of new adaptations to terrestrial existence in animals, such as limbed appendages in amphibians and epidermal
scales in reptiles.
Changes in the environment often create new niches (diversified living spaces) that invite rapid speciation and increased
diversity. On the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in
devastating losses of diversity to some clades, yet provide new opportunities for others to “fill in the gaps” and speciate. Such
periods ofmass extinction(Figure 27.19) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines
while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind. The end of the Permian period (and the Paleozoic Era)
was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth’s history, a loss of an estimated 95 percent of the extant species at that
time. Some of the dominant phyla in the world’s oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely. On land, the
disappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge, the dinosaurs.
The warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into
every conceivable niche in land, air, and water. Plants, too, radiated into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex
communities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available.
Another mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period, bringing the Mesozoic Era to an end. Skies
darkened and temperatures fell after a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash ejected into the atmosphere blocked
incoming sunlight. Plants died, herbivores and carnivores starved, and the dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to
the more warm-blooded mammals. In the following Cenozoic Era, mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once
occupied by dinosaurs, and birds—the warm-blooded direct descendants of one line of the ruling reptiles—became aerial
specialists. The appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for pollinating insects, as
well as for birds and mammals. Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also
promoted by a dramatic shift in Earth’s geography, as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions, leaving
some animal groups isolated on islands and continents, or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other
competitors. Early in the Cenozoic, new ecosystems appeared, with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs. Late in the
Cenozoic, further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then
retreated, leaving new open spaces for colonization.

Phylum Porifera
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the organizational features of the simplest multicellular organisms
• Explain the various body forms and bodily functions of sponges
As we have seen, the vast majority of invertebrate animals donotpossess a defined bony vertebral
endoskeleton, or a bony cranium. However, one of the most ancestral groups of deuterostome invertebrates,
the Echinodermata, do produce tiny skeletal “bones” calledossiclesthat make up a trueendoskeleton, or
internal skeleton, covered by an epidermis.
We will start our investigation with the simplest of all the invertebrates—animals sometimes classified
within the clade Parazoa (“beside the animals”). This clade currently includes only the phylum Placozoa
(containing a single species,Trichoplax adhaerens), and the phylumPorifera, containing the more familiar
sponges (Figure 28.2). The split between the Parazoa and the Eumetazoa (all animal clades above Parazoa)
likely took place over a billion years ago.
We should reiterate here that the Porifera do not possess “true” tissues that are embryologically homologous
to those of all other derived animal groups such as the insects and mammals. This is because they do not
create a true gastrula during embryogenesis, and as a result do not produce a true endoderm or ectoderm.
But even though they are not considered to have true tissues, they do have specialized cells that perform
specific functionslike tissues(for example, the external “pinacoderm” of a sponge acts like our epidermis).
Thus,functionally, the poriferans can be said to have tissues; however, these tissues are likely not
embryologicallyhomologous to our own.
Sponge larvae (e.g, parenchymula and amphiblastula) are flagellated and able to swim; however, adults are
non-motile and spend their life attached to a substratum. Since water is vital to sponges for feeding,
excretion, and gas exchange, their body structure facilitates the movement of water through the sponge.
Various canals, chambers, and cavities enable water to move through the sponge to allow the exchange of
food and waste as well as the exchange of gases to nearly all body cells.
Figure28.2Sponges. Sponges are members of the phylum Porifera, which contains the simplest invertebrates.

Morphology of Sponges
There are at least 5,000 named species of sponges, likely with thousands more yet to be classified. The
morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of an irregular cylinder with a large central cavity, the
spongocoel, occupying the inside of the cylinder (Figure 28.3). Water enters into the spongocoel through
numerous pores, orostia, that create openings in the body wall. Water entering the spongocoel is expelled
via a large common opening called theosculum. However, we should note that sponges exhibit a range of
diversity in body forms, including variations in the size and shape of the spongocoel, as well as the number

and arrangement of feeding chambers within the body wall. In some sponges, multiple feeding chambers open off of a central
spongocoel and in others, several feeding chambers connecting to one another may lie between the entry pores and the
spongocoel.
While sponges do not exhibit true tissue-layer organization, they do have a number of functional “tissues” composed of different
cell types specialized for distinct functions. For example, epithelial-like cells calledpinacocytesform the outermost body, called
apinacoderm, that serves a protective function similar that of our epidermis. Scattered among the pinacoderm are the ostia
that allow entry of water into the body of the sponge. These pores have given the sponges their phylum name Porifera—pore-
bearers. In some sponges, ostia are formed byporocytes, single tube-shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water
into the spongocoel. In other sponges, ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge. Between the outer layer and the
feeding chambers of the sponge is a jelly-like substance called themesohyl, which contains collagenous fibers. Various cell types
reside within the mesohyl, includingamoebocytes, the “stem cells” of sponges, andsclerocytes, which produce skeletal
materials. The gel-like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges.
The feeding chambers inside the sponge are lined by choanocytes ("collar cells"). The structure of a choanocyte is critical to its
function, which is to generate adirectedwater current through the sponge and to trap and ingest microscopic food particles by
phagocytosis. These feeding cells are similar in appearance to unicellularchoanoflagellates(Protista). This similarity suggests
that sponges and choanoflagellates are closely related and likely share common ancestry. The body of the choanocyte is
embedded in mesohyl and contains all the organelles required for normal cell function. Protruding into the “open space” inside
the feeding chamber is a mesh-like collar composed of microvilli with a single flagellum in the center of the column. The beating
of the flagella from all choanocytes draws water into the sponge through the numerous ostia, into the spaces lined by
choanocytes, and eventually out through the osculum (or osculi, if the sponge consists of a colony of attached sponges). Food
particles, including waterborne bacteria and unicellular organisms such as algae and various animal-like protists, are trapped
by the sieve-like collar of the choanocytes, slide down toward the body of the cell, and are ingested by phagocytosis. Choanocytes
also serve another surprising function: They can differentiate into sperm for sexual reproduction, at which time they become
dislodged from the mesohyl and leave the sponge with expelled water through the osculum.

the sponge, they also give rise to eggs for sexual reproduction. (The eggs remain in the mesohyl, whereas the sperm cells are
released into the water.) The amoebocytes can differentiate into other cell types of the sponge, such as collenocytes and
lophocytes, which produce the collagen-like protein that support the mesohyl. Amoebocytes can also give rise to sclerocytes,
which producespicules(skeletal spikes of silica or calcium carbonate) in some sponges, and spongocytes, which produce the
protein spongin in the majority of sponges. These different cell types in sponges are shown inFigure 28.3.

Physiological Processes in Sponges
Sponges, despite being simple organisms, regulate their different physiological processes through a variety of mechanisms.
These processes regulate their metabolism, reproduction, and locomotion.
Digestion
Sponges lack complex digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems. Their food is trapped as water passes through the
ostia and out through the osculum. Bacteria smaller than 0.5 microns in size are trapped by choanocytes, which are the
principal cells engaged in feeding, and are ingested by phagocytosis. However, particles that are larger than the ostia may be
phagocytized at the sponge's surface by pinacocytes. In some sponges, amoebocytes transport food from cells that have ingested
food particles to those that do not. In sponges, in spite of what looks like a large digestive cavity, all digestion isintracellular.
The limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual sponge cells.
All other major body functions in the sponge (gas exchange, circulation, excretion) are performed by diffusion between the cells
that line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings. All cell types within the sponge
obtain oxygen from water through diffusion. Likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion. In addition,
nitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it
passes through the sponge.
Some sponges host green algae or cyanobacteria as endosymbionts within archeocytes and other cells. It may be a surprise to
learn that there are nearly 150 species of carnivorous sponges, which feed primarily on tiny crustaceans, snaring them through
sticky threads or hooked spicules!
Although there is no specialized nervous system in sponges, there is intercellular communication that can regulate events like
contraction of the sponge's body or the activity of the choanocytes.
Reproduction
Sponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods. The typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation
(during this process, a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual), or budding
(a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony). An
atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation ofgemmules.
Gemmulesare environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges (e.g., in the freshwater spongeSpongilla). In
gemmules, an inner layer of archeocytes (amoebocytes) is surrounded by a pneumatic cellular layer that may be reinforced with
spicules. In freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature, and then
serve to recolonize the habitat once environmental conditions improve and stabilize. Gemmules are capable of attaching to a
substratum and generating a new sponge. Since gemmules can withstand harsh environments, are resistant to desiccation, and

Phylum Cnidaria
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Compare structural and organization characteristics of Porifera and Cnidaria
• Describe the progressive development of tissues and their relevance to animal complexity
• Identify the two general body forms found in the Cnidaria
• Describe the identifying features of the major cnidarian classes
PhylumCnidariaincludes animals that exhibit radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic, meaning that they develop from
two embryonic layers, ectoderm and endoderm. Nearly all (about 99 percent) cnidarians are marine species.
Whereas the defining cell type for the sponges is the choanocyte, the defining cell type for the cnidarians is thecnidocyte, or
stinging cell. These cells are located around the mouth and on the tentacles, and serve to capture prey or repel predators.
Cnidocytes have large stinging organelles callednematocysts, which usually contain barbs at the base of a long coiled thread.
The outer wall of the cell has a hairlike projection called acnidocil, which is sensitive to tactile stimulation. If the cnidocils are
touched, the hollow threads evert with enormous acceleration, approaching 40,000 times that of gravity. The microscopic
threads then either entangle the prey or instantly penetrate the flesh of the prey or predator, releasing toxins (including
neurotoxins and pore-forming toxins that can lead to cell lysis) into the target, thereby immobilizing it or paralyzing it (see
Figure 28.5).

Two distinct body plans are found in Cnidarians: the polyp or tuliplike "stalk" form and the medusa or "bell" form. (Figure 28.6).
An example of the polyp form is found in the genusHydra, whereas the most typical form of medusa is found in the group called
the “sea jellies” (jellyfish). Polyp forms are sessile as adults, with a single opening (the mouth/anus) to the digestive cavity facing
up with tentacles surrounding it. Medusa forms are motile, with the mouth and tentacles hanging down from an umbrella-
shaped bell.
Figure28.6Cnidarian body forms. Cnidarians have two distinct body plans, the medusa (a) and the polyp (b). All cnidarians have two
membrane layers, with a jelly-like mesoglea between them.
Some cnidarians aredimorphic, that is, they exhibit both body plans during their life cycle. In these species, the polyp serves as
the asexual phase, while the medusa serves as the sexual stage and produces gametes. However, both body forms are diploid.
An example of cnidarian dimorphism can be seen in the colonial hydroidObelia. The sessile asexual colony has two types of
polyps, shown inFigure 28.7. The first is thegastrozooid, which is adapted for capturing prey and feeding. InObelia, all polyps
are connected through a common digestive cavity called acoenosarc. The other type of polyp is thegonozooid, adapted for the
asexual budding and the production of sexual medusae. The reproductive buds from the gonozooid break off and mature into
free-swimming medusae, which are either male or female (dioecious). Each medusa has either several testes or several ovaries
in which meiosis occurs to produce sperm or egg cells. Interestingly, the gamete-producing cells do not arise within the gonad

• Phylum Cnidaria 731
Despite the simplicity of the nervous system, it is remarkable that it coordinates the complicated movement of the tentacles, the
drawing of captured prey to the mouth, the digestion of food, and the expulsion of waste.
The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus; this arrangement is called an
incomplete digestive system. In the gastrovascular cavity, extracellular digestion occurs as food is taken into the gastrovascular
cavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients. However, some intracellular
digestion also occurs. The gastrovascular cavity distributes nutrients throughout the body of the animal, with nutrients passing
from the digestive cavity across the mesoglea to the epidermal cells. Thus, this cavity serves both digestive and circulatory
functions.
Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and water in the environment,
and between cells in the gastrodermis and water in the gastrovascular cavity. The lack of a circulatory system to move dissolved
gases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a non-living mesoglea between the layers. In the cnidarians with a
thicker mesoglea, a number of canals help to distribute both nutrients and gases. There is neither an excretory system nor
organs, and nitrogenous wastes simply diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or into the gastrovascular cavity.
The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into two monophyletic clades: the Anthozoa and the
Medusozoa. The Anthozoa include the corals, sea fans, sea whips, and the sea anemones. The Medusozoa include several classes
of Cnidaria in two clades: The Hydrozoa include sessile forms, some medusoid forms, and swimming colonial forms like the
Portuguese man-of-war. The other clade contains various types of jellies including both Scyphozoa and Cubozoa. The Anthozoa
contain only sessile polyp forms, while the Medusozoa include species with both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle.
Class Anthozoa
The class Anthozoa ("flower animals") includes sea anemones (Figure 28.8), sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of
6,100 described species. Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter. Individual
animals are cylindrical in shape and are attached directly to a substrate.

• Phylum Cnidaria 733
In the sea jelly, a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal, surrounded by hollow tentacles bearing
nematocysts. Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the
gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, calleddiverticuli. In some species, the digestive
system may branch further intoradial canals. Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two
functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion, and to support the body of the animal.
In scyphozoans, nerve cells are organized in a nerve net that extends over the entire body, with a nerve ring around the edge of
the bell. Clusters of sensory organs called rhopalia may be present in pockets in the edge of the bell. Jellies have a ring of muscles
lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water, as well as to draw in food from
the water as they swim. Scyphozoans have separate sexes. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are
expelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form.
These polyps may bud to form additional polyps or begin immediately to produce medusa buds. In a few species, the planula
larva may develop directly into the medusa. The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of most scyphozoans includes both sexual medusoid and
asexual polypoid body forms.
Figure28.10Scyphozoan life cycle. The lifecycle of most jellyfish includes two stages: the medusa stage and the polyp stage. The polyp
reproduces asexually by budding, and the medusa reproduces sexually. (credit "medusa": modification of work by Francesco Crippa)
Class Cubozoa
This class includes jellies that have a box-shaped medusa, or a bell that is square in cross-section, and are colloquially known as
“box jellyfish.” These species may achieve sizes of 15 to 25 cm, but typically members of the Cubozoa are not as large as those of
the Scyphozoa. However, cubozoans display overall morphological and anatomical characteristics that are similar to those of the
scyphozoans. A prominent difference between the two classes is the arrangement of tentacles. The cubozoans contain muscular
pads calledpedaliaat the corners of the square bell canopy, with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium. In some
cases, the digestive system may extend into the pedalia. Nematocysts may be arranged in a spiral configuration along the
tentacles; this arrangement helps to effectively subdue and capture prey. Cubozoans include the most venomous of all the
cnidarians (Figure 28.11).

(Thysanozoon nigropapillosum). (credit a: modification of work by Stephen Childs; b: modification of work by Pril Fish.)
Flatworms have three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to epidermal tissues (from ectoderm), the lining of the digestive
system (from endoderm), and other internal tissues (from mesoderm). The epidermal tissue is a single layer of cells or a layer of
fused cells (syncytium) that covers two layers of muscle, one circular and the other longitudinal. The mesodermal tissues include
mesenchymal cells that contain collagen and support secretory cells that produce mucus and other materials at the surface.
Because flatworms are acoelomates, the mesodermal layer forms a solid mass between the outer epidermal surface and the
cavity of the digestive system.
Physiological Processes of Flatworms
The free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers. Parasitic forms feed by absorbing nutrients provided by their
hosts. Most flatworms, such as the planarian shown inFigure 28.14, have a branching gastrovascular cavity rather than a
complete digestive system. In such animals, the “mouth” is also used to expel waste materials from the digestive system, and
thus also serves as an anus. (A few species may have a second anal pore or opening.) The gut may be a simple sac or highly
branched. Digestion is primarily extracellular, with digested materials taken into the cells of the gut lining by phagocytosis. One
parasitic group, the tapeworms (cestodes), lacks a digestive system altogether, and absorb digested food from the host.
Flatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules attached toflame cells, whose cilia beat to direct waste fluids
concentrated in the tubules out of the body through excretory pores. The system is responsible for the regulation of dissolved
salts and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes. The nervous system consists of a pair of lateral nerve cords running the length of
the body with transverse connections between them. Two large cerebral ganglia—concentrations of nerve cell bodies at the
anterior end of the worm—are associated with photosensory and chemosensory cells. There is neither a circulatory nor a
respiratory system, with gas and nutrient exchange dependent on diffusion and cell-to-cell junctions. This necessarily limits the
thickness of the body in these organisms, constraining them to be “flat” worms. Most flatworm species aremonoecious(both
male and female reproductive organs are found in the same individual), and fertilization is typically internal. Asexual
reproduction by fission is common in some groups.

hepatica(two specimens on left, also known as the common liver fluke). (d) Class Cestoda includes tapeworms such as thisTaenia
saginata, infects both cattle and humans, and can reach 4 to 10 meters in length; the specimen shown here is about four meters long.

Most free-living flatworms are marine polycladids, although tricladid species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial
environments, and there are a number of members from other orders in both environments. The ventral epidermis of free-living
flatworms is ciliated, which facilitates their locomotion. Some free-living flatworms are capable of remarkable feats of
regeneration in which an individual may regrow its head or tail after being severed, or even several heads if the planaria is cut
lengthwise.
The monogeneans areectoparasites, mostly of fish, with simple life cycles that consist of a free-swimming larva that attaches to
a fish, prior to its transformation to the ectoparasitic adult form. The parasite has only one host and that host is usually very
specific. The worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues, or they may simply graze on surface mucus and skin
particles. Most monogeneans are hermaphroditic, but the male gametes develop first and so cross-fertilization is quite
common.
The trematodes, or flukes, are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups, including humans. Trematodes have
complex life cycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs, and one or more secondary hosts in which
asexual reproduction occurs. The primary host is usually a vertebrate and the secondary host is almost always a mollusk, in
which multiple larvae are produced asexually. Trematodes, which attached internally to the host via an oral and medial sucker,
are responsible for serious human diseases including schistosomiasis, caused by several species of the blood fluke,Schistosoma

Phylum Rotifera
The rotifers ("wheel-bearer") belong to a group of microscopic (about 100 µm to 2 mm) mostly aquatic animals that get their
name from thecorona—a pair of ciliated feeding structures that appear to rotate when viewed under the light microscope
(Figure 28.17). Although their taxonomic status is currently in flux, one treatment places the rotifers in three classes: Bdelloidea,
Monogononta, and Seisonidea. In addition, the parasitic “spiny headed worms” currently in phylum Acanthocephala, appear to
be modified rotifers and will probably be placed into the group in the near future. Undoubtedly the rotifers will continue to be
revised as more phylogenetic evidence becomes available.
The pseudocoelomate body of a rotifer is remarkably complex for such a small animal (roughly the size of aParamecium) and is
divided into three sections: ahead(which contains the corona), atrunk(which contains most of the internal organs), and the
foot. A cuticle, rigid in some species and flexible in others, covers the body surface. They have both skeletal muscle associated
with locomotion and visceral muscles associated with the gut, both composed of single cells. Rotifers are typically free-
swimming or planktonic (drifting) organisms, but the toes or extensions of the foot can secrete a sticky material to help them
adhere to surfaces. The head contains a number of eyespots and a bilobed “brain,” with nerves extending into the body.

Phylum Nemertea
The Nemertea are colloquially known asribbon wormsor proboscis worms. Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine and
predominantly benthic (bottom dwellers), with an estimated 900 known species. However, nemerteans have been recorded in
freshwater and very damp terrestrial habitats as well. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on worms, clams, and
crustaceans. Some species are scavengers, and some, likeMalacobdella grossa, have also evolved commensal relationships with
mollusks. Economically important species have at times devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have
almost no predators and two species are sold as fish bait.
Morphology
Nemerteans vary in size from 1 cm to several meters. They show bilateral symmetry and remarkable contractile properties.
Because of their contractility, they can change their morphological presentation in response to environmental cues. Animals in
phylum Nemertea are soft and unsegmented animals, with a morphology like a flattened tube. (Figure 28.19).

these animals to facilitate osmoregulation. Gaseous exchange occurs through the skin.
Nervous System
Nemerteans have a "brain" composed of four ganglia situated at the anterior end, around the rhynchocoel. Paired longitudinal
nerve cords emerge from the brain ganglia and extend to the posterior end. Additional nerve cords are found in some species.
Interestingly, the brain can contain hemoglobin, which acts as an oxygen reserve.Ocellior eyespots are present in pairs, in
multiples of two in the anterior portion of the body. It is speculated that the eyespots originate from neural tissue and not from
the epidermis.
Reproduction
Nemerteans, like flatworms, have excellent powers of regeneration, and asexual reproduction by fragmentation is seen in some
species. Most animals in phylum Nemertea are dioecious, although freshwater species may be hermaphroditic. Stem cells that
become gametes aggregate within gonads placed along the digestive tract. Eggs and sperm are released into the water, and
fertilization occurs externally. Like most lophotrochozoan protostomes, cleavage is spiral, and development is usually direct,
although some species have a trochophore-like larva, in which a young worm is constructed from a series of imaginal discs that
begin as invaginations from the body surface of the larva.

## Section 498.2
Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the unique anatomical and morphological features of molluscs and annelids
• Describe the formation of the coelom
• Identify an important extracoelomic cavity in molluscs
• Describe the major body regions of Mollusca and how they vary in different molluscan classes
• Discuss the advantages of true body segmentation
• Describe the features of animals classified in phylum Annelida
The annelids and the mollusks are the most familiar of the lophotrochozoan protostomes. They are also more “typical”
lophotrochozoans, since both groups include aquatic species with trochophore larvae, which unite both taxa in common
ancestry. These phyla show how a flexible body plan can lead to biological success in terms of abundance and species diversity.
The phylum Mollusca has the second greatest number of species of all animal phyla with nearly 100,000 described extant
species, and about 80,000 described extinct species. In fact, it is estimated that about 25 percent of all known marine species
are mollusks! The annelids and mollusca are both bilaterally symmetrical, cephalized, triploblastic, schizocoelous
eucoeolomates They include animals you are likely to see in your backyard or on your dinner plate!
Phylum Mollusca
The name “Mollusca” means “soft” body, since the earliest descriptions of molluscs came from observations of “squishy,”
unshelled cuttlefish. Molluscs are predominantly a marine group of animals; however, they are also known to inhabit freshwater
as well as terrestrial habitats. This enormous phylum includes chitons, tusk shells, snails, slugs, nudibranchs, sea butterflies,
clams, mussels, oysters, squids, octopuses, and nautiluses. Molluscs display a wide range of morphologies in each class and
subclass, but share a few key characteristics (Figure 28.21). The chief locomotor structure is usually a muscularfoot. Most
internal organs are contained in a region called thevisceral mass. Overlying the visceral mass is a fold of tissue called the
mantle; within the cavity formed by the mantle are respiratory structures calledgills, that typically fold over the visceral mass.
The mouths of most mollusks, except bivalves (e.g., clams) contain a specialized feeding organ called aradula, an abrasive
tonguelike structure. Finally, the mantle secretes a calcium-carbonate-hardened shell in most molluscs, although this is greatly
reduced in the class Cephalopoda, which contains the octopuses and squids.

Although these animals lack a calcareous shell, they get some protection from calcareous spicules embedded in a cuticle that
covers their epidermis. The mantle cavity is reduced, and both groups lack eyes, tentacles, and nephridia (excretory organs). The
Caudofoveata possess a radula, but the Solenogastres do not have a radula or gills. The foot is also reduced in the Solenogastres
and absent from the Caudofoveata.
Long thought to be extinct, the first living specimens of Monoplacophora,Neopilina galatheae, were discovered in 1952 on the
ocean bottom near the west coast of Costa Rica. Today there are over 25 described species. Members of class Monoplacophora
(“bearing one plate”) possess a single, cap-like shell that covers the dorsal body. The morphology of the shell and the underlying
animal can vary from circular to ovate. They have a simple radula, a looped digestive system, multiple pairs of excretory organs,
and a pair of gonads. Multiple gills are located between the foot and the edge of the mantle.
Animals in class Polyplacophora (“bearing many plates”) are commonly known as “chitons” and bear eight limy plates that make
up the dorsal shell (Figure 28.22). These animals have a broad, ventral foot that is adapted for suction onto rocks and other
substrates, and a mantle that extends beyond the edge of the shell. Calcareous spines on the exposed mantle edge provide
protection from predators. Respiration is facilitated by multiple pairs of gills in the mantle cavity. Blood from the gills is
collected in a posterior heart, and then sent to the rest of the body in ahemocoel—anopen circulation systemin which the
blood is contained in connected chambers surrounding various organs rather than within individual blood vessels. The radula,
which has teeth composed of an ultra-hard magnetite, is used to scrape food organisms off rocky surfaces. Chiton teeth have
been shown to exhibit the greatest hardness and stiffness of any biomineral material reported to date, being as much as three-
times harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate-based shells of mollusks.
The nervous system is rudimentary with only buccal or “cheek” ganglia present at the anterior end. Multiple tiny sensory
structures, including photosensors, extend from the mantle into channels in the upper layer of the shell. These structures are
calledesthetesand are unique to the chitons. Another sensory structure under the radula is used to sample the feeding
environment. A single pair of nephridia is used for the excretion of nitrogenous wastes.
Figure28.22A chiton. This chiton from the class Polyplacaphora has the eight-plated shell for which its class is named. (credit: Jerry
Kirkhart)
Class Bivalvia (“two-valves”) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, geoducks, and shipworms. Some bivalves are almost
microscopic, while others, in the genusTridacna,may be one meter in length and weigh 225 kilograms. Members of this class
are found in marine as well as freshwater habitats. As the name suggests, bivalves are enclosed in two-part valves or shells
(Figure 28.23a) fused on the dorsal side by hinge ligaments as well as shell teeth on the ventral side that keep the two halves
aligned. The two shells, which consist of an outer organic layer, a middle prismatic layer, and a very smooth nacreous layer, are
joined at the oldest part of the shell called the umbo. Anterior and posterior adductor and abductor muscles close and open the
shell respectively.
The overall body of the bivalve is laterally flattened; the foot is wedge-shaped; and the head region is poorly developed (with no
obvious mouth). Bivalves are filter-feeders, and a radula is absent in this class of mollusks. The mantle cavity is fused along the
edges except for openings for the foot and for the intake and expulsion of water, which is circulated through the mantle cavity by
the actions of the incurrent and excurrent siphons. During water intake by the incurrent siphon, food particles are captured by
the paired posterior gills (ctenidia) and then carried by the movement of cilia forward to the mouth. Excretion and
osmoregulation are performed by a pair of nephridia. Eyespots and other sensory structures are located along the edge of the

head end can now be withdrawn into the protection of the shell, and the tougher foot (and sometimes the protective covering or
operculum) forms a barrier to the outside. The strange arrangement that results from torsion poses a serious sanitation
problem by creating the possibility of wastes being washed back over the gills, causingfouling.There is actually no really perfect
explanation for the embryonic development of torsion, and some groups that formerly exhibited torsion in their ancestral
groups are now known to have reversed the process.
Gastropods also have a foot that is modified for crawling. Most gastropods have a well-defined head with tentacles and eyes. A
complex radula is used to scrape up food particles. In aquatic gastropods, the mantle cavity encloses the gills (ctenidia), but in
land gastropods, the mantle itself is the major respiratory structure, acting as a kind of lung.Nephridia(“kidneys”) are also
found in the mantle cavity.
Figure28.25Torsion in gastropods. During embryonic development of some gastropods, the visceral mass undergoes torsion, or
counterclockwise rotation of the visceral anatomical features. As a result, the anus of the adult animal is located over the head. Although
torsion is always counterclockwise, the shell may coil in either direction; thus coiling of a shell isnotthe same as torsion of the visceral
mass.
Everyday Connection
Can Snail Venom Be Used as a Pharmacological Painkiller?
Marine snails of the genusConus(Figure 28.26) attack prey with a venomous stinger, modified from the radula. The toxin
released, known as conotoxin, is a peptide with internal disulfide linkages. Conotoxins can bring about paralysis in
humans, indicating that this toxin attacks neurological targets. Some conotoxins have been shown to block neuronal ion
channels. These findings have led researchers to study conotoxins for possible medical applications.
Conotoxins are an exciting area of potential pharmacological development, since these peptides may be possibly modified
and used in specific medical conditions to inhibit the activity of specific neurons. For example, conotoxins or modifications
of them may be used to induce paralysis in muscles in specific health applications, similar to the use of botulinum toxin.
Since the entire spectrum of conotoxins, as well as their mechanisms of action, is not completely known, the study of their
potential applications is still in its infancy. Most research to date has focused on their use to treat neurological diseases.
They have also shown some efficacy in relieving chronic pain, and the pain associated with conditions like sciatica and
shingles. The study and use of biotoxins—toxins derived from living organisms—are an excellent example of the application
of biological science to modern medicine.

systems with a ring of fused ganglia present around the pharynx. The nerve cord is ventral in position and bears enlarged nodes
or ganglia in each segment.
Figure28.30Segmental anatomy of an earthworm. This schematic drawing shows the basic anatomy of annelids in a cross-sectional view.
Annelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads (as in earthworms and leeches) or dioecious with temporary or
seasonal gonads (as in polychaetes). However, cross-fertilization is preferred even in hermaphroditic animals. Earthworms may
show simultaneous mutual fertilization when they are aligned for copulation. Some leeches change their sex over their
reproductive lifetimes. In most polychaetes, fertilization is external and development includes a trochophore larva, which then
metamorphoizes to the adult form. In oligochaetes, fertilization is typically internal and the fertilized eggs develop in a cocoon
produced by the clitellum; development is direct. Polychaetes are excellent regenerators and some even reproduce asexually by
budding or fragmentation.

This combinationvideo and animation(http://shapeoflife.org/video/animation/annelid-animation-body-plan)provides a close-
up look at annelid anatomy.
Classification of Phylum Annelida
Phylum Annelida contains the class Polychaeta (the polychaetes) and the class Oligochaeta (the earthworms, leeches, and their
relatives). The earthworms and the leeches form a monophyletic clade within the polychaetes, which are therefore paraphyletic
as a group.
There are more than 22,000 different species of annelids, and more than half of these are marine polychaetes ("many bristles").
In the polychaetes, bristles are arranged in clusters on their parapodia—fleshy, flat, paired appendages that protrude from each
segment. Many polychaetes use their parapodia to crawl along the sea floor, but others are adapted for swimming or floating.
Some are sessile, living in tubes. Some polychaetes live near hydrothermal vents. These deepwater tubeworms have no digestive
tract, but have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria living in their bodies.
Earthworms are the most abundant members of the class Oligochaeta ("few bristles"), distinguished by the presence of a
permanent clitellum as well as the small number of reduced chaetae on each segment. (Recall that oligochaetes do not have
parapodia.) The oligochaete subclass Hirudinea, includes leeches such as the medicinal leech,Hirudo medicinalis, which is
effective at increasing blood circulation and breaking up blood clots, and thus can be used to treat some circulatory disorders
and cardiovascular diseases. Their use goes back thousands of years. These animals produce a seasonal clitellum, unlike the
permanent clitellum of other oligochaetes. A significant difference between leeches and other annelids is the lack of setae and
the development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends, which are used to attach to the host animal. Additionally, in
leeches, the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to the internal segmentation of the coelomic cavity. This
adaptation possibly helps the leeches to elongate when they ingest copious quantities of blood from host vertebrates, a condition
in which they are said to be “engorged.” The subclass Brachiobdella includes tiny leechlike worms that attach themselves to the

Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Nematodes and Tardigrades
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the structural organization of nematodes
• Describe the importance of Caenorhabditis elegans in research
• Describe the features of Tardigrades
Superphylum Ecdysozoa
The superphylum Ecdysozoa contains an incredibly large number of species. This is because it contains two of the most diverse
animal groups: phylum Nematoda (the roundworms) and phylum Arthropoda (the arthropods). The most prominent
distinguishing feature of ecdysozoans is the cuticle—a tough, but flexible exoskeleton that protects these animals from water
loss, predators, and other dangers of the external environment. One small phylum within the Ecdysozoa, with exceptional
resistance to desiccation and other environmental hazards, is the Tardigrada. The nematodes, tardigrades, and arthropods all
belong to the superphylum Ecdysozoa, which is believed to bemonophyletic—a clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants
from one common ancestor. All members of this superphylum periodically go through a molting process that culminates in
ecdysis—the actual shedding of the old exoskeleton. (The term “ecdysis” translates roughly as “take off” or “strip.”) During the
molting process, old cuticle is replaced by a new cuticle, which is secreted beneath it, and which will last until the next growth
period.
Phylum Nematoda
The Nematoda, like other members of the superphylum Ecdysozoa, are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm that is
sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm. They are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section
will divide them into right and left sides that are superficially symmetrical. In contrast with flatworms, nematodes are
pseudocoelomates and show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. Nematodes include both free-living and parasitic
forms.
In 1914, N.A. Cobb said, “In short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still
be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales,
rivers, lakes and oceans represented by a thin film of nematodes...” To paraphrase Cobb, nematodes are so abundant that if all
the non-nematode matter of the biosphere were removed, there would still remain a shadow of the former world outlined by
nematodes!1The phylum Nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature.
However, nematologists believe there may be over one million unclassified species.
The name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word “Nemos,” which means “thread,” and includes all true roundworms.
Nematodes are present in all habitats, typically with each species occurring in great abundance. The free-living nematode,
Caenorhabditis elegans, has been extensively used as a model system for many different avenues of biological inquiry in
laboratories all over the world.

Morphology
The cylindrical body form of the nematodes is seen inFigure 28.32. These animals have a complete digestive system with a
distinct mouth and anus, whereas only one opening is present in the digestive tract of flatworms. The mouth opens into a
muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. The epidermis can be either a
single layer of cells or asyncytium—a multinucleated tissue that in this case is formed by the fusion of many single cells. The
cuticle of nematodes is rich in collagen and a polymer calledchitin, which forms a protective armor outside the epidermis. The
cuticle extends into both ends of the digestive tract, the pharynx, and rectum. In the head, an anterior mouth opening is
composed of three (or six) “lips” as well as teeth derived from the cuticle (in some species). Some nematodes may present other
modifications of the cuticle such as rings, head shields, or warts. These external rings, however, do not reflecttrueinternal body
segmentation, which as we have seen is a hallmark of phylum Annelida. The attachment of the muscles of nematodes differs
from that of most animals: they have a longitudinal layer only, and their direct attachment to the dorsal and ventral nerve cords
creates a strong muscular contraction that results in a whiplike, almost spastic, body movement.

Excretory System
In nematodes, specialized excretory systems are not well developed. Nitrogenous wastes, largely in the form ofammonia, are
released directly across the body wall. In some nematodes, osmoregulation and salt balance are performed by simple excretory
cells or glands that may be connected to paired canals that release wastes through an anterior pore. In marine nematodes, the
excretory cells are calledrenette cells, which are unique to nematodes.
Nervous system
Most nematodes have four longitudinal nerve cords that run along the length of the body in dorsal, ventral, and lateral
positions. The ventral nerve cord is better developed than the dorsal and lateral cords. Nonetheless, all nerve cords fuse at the

that does not age significantly and is somewhat analogous to the diapausing state of some insects. (credit a: modification of work by

Parasitic Nematodes
A number of common parasitic nematodes serve as prime examples of parasitism (endoparasitism). These economically and
medically important animals exhibit complex life cycles that often involve multiple hosts, and they can have significant medical
and veterinary impacts. Here is a partial list of nasty nematodes: Humans may become infected byDracunculus medinensis,
known as guinea worms, when they drink unfiltered water containing copepods (Figure 28.34), an intermediate crustacean host.
Hookworms, such asAncylostomaandNecator, infest the intestines and feed on the blood of mammals, especially of dogs, cats,
and humans. Trichina worms (Trichinella) are the causal organism of trichinosis in humans, often resulting from the
consumption of undercooked pork;Trichinellacan infect other mammalian hosts as well.Ascaris, a large intestinal roundworm,
steals nutrition from its human host and may create physical blockage of the intestines. The filarial worms, such asDirofilaria
andWuchereria, are commonly vectored by mosquitoes, which pass the infective agents among mammals through their blood-
sucking activity. One species,Wuchereria bancrofti, infects the lymph nodes of over 120 million people worldwide, usually
producing a non-lethal but deforming condition calledelephantiasis. In this disease, parts of the body often swell to gigantic
proportions due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage, inflammation of lymphatic tissues, and resulting edema.Dirofilaria
immitis, a blood-infective parasite, is the notorious dog heartworm species.

Morphology and Physiology
Tardigrades have cylindrical bodies, with four pairs of legs terminating in a number of claws. The cuticle is periodically shed,
including the cuticular covering of the claws. The first three pairs of legs are used for walking, and the posterior pair for clinging
to the substrate. A circular mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and salivary glands. Tardigrades feed on plants, algae, or small
animals. Plant cells are pierced with a chitinous stylet and the cellular contents are then sucked into the gut by the muscular
pharynx. Bands of single muscle cells are attached to the various points of the epidermis and extend into the legs to provide
ambulatory movement. The major body cavity is ahemocoel, but there are no specialized circulatory structures for moving the
blood, nor are there specialized respiratory structures. Malpighian tubules in the hemocoel remove metabolic wastes and
transport them to the gut. A dorsal brain is connected to a ventral nerve cord with segmental ganglia associated with the
appendages. Sensory structures are greatly reduced, but there is a pair of simple eyespots on the head, and sensory cilia or
bristles concentrated toward the head end of the animal.
Reproduction
Most tardigrades are dioecious, and males and females each have a single gonad. Mating usually occurs at the time of a molt and
fertilization is external. Eggs may be deposited in a molted cuticle or attached to other objects. Development is direct, and the
animal may molt a dozen times during its lifetime. In tardigrades, like nematodes, development produces a fixed number of
cells, with the actual number of cells being dependent on the species. Further growth occurs by enlarging the cells, not by
multiplying them.

Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Arthropods
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Compare the internal systems and appendage specializations of phylum Arthropoda
• Discuss the environmental importance of arthropods
• Discuss the reasons for arthropod success and abundance
The superphylum Ecdysozoa also includes the phylum Arthropoda, one of the most successful clades of animals on the planet.
Arthropods are coelomate organisms characterized by a sturdy chitinous exoskeleton and jointed appendages. There are well
over a million arthropod species described, and systematists believe that there are millions of species awaiting proper
classification. Like other Ecdysozoa, all arthropods periodically go through the physiological process ofmolting, followed by
ecdysis(the actual shedding of the exoskeleton), as they grow. Arthropods are eucoelomate, protostomic organisms, often with
incredibly complicated life cycles.

Figure28.36A trilobite. Trilobites, like the one in this fossil, are an extinct group of arthropods. Their name "trilobite" refers to thethree
longitudinal lobesmaking up the body: right pleural lobe, axial lobe, and left pleural lobe (credit: Kevin Walsh).
Morphology
Characteristic features of the arthropods include the presence of jointed appendages, body segmentation, and chitinized
exoskeleton. Fusion of adjacent groups of segments gave rise to functional body regions called tagmata (singular = tagma).
Tagmata may be in the form of a head, thorax, and abdomen, or a cephalothorax and abdomen, or a head and trunk, depending
on the taxon. Commonly described tagmata may be composed of different numbers of segments; for example, the head of most
insects results from the fusion of six ancestral segments, whereas the “head” of another arthropod may be made of fewer
ancestral segments, due to independent evolutionary events. Jointed arthropod appendages, often in segmental pairs, have been
specialized for various functions: sensing their environment (antennae), capturing and manipulating food (mandibles and
maxillae), as well as for walking, jumping, digging, and swimming.
In the arthropod body, a central cavity, called thehemocoel(or blood cavity), is present, and the hemocoel fluids are moved by
contraction of regions of the tubular dorsal blood vessel called "hearts." Groups of arthropods also differ in the organs used for
nitrogenous waste excretion, with crustaceans possessinggreen glandsand insects usingMalpighian tubules, which work in
conjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body of nitrogenous waste. The nervous system tends to be
distributed among the segments, with larger ganglia in segments with sensory structures or appendages. The ganglia are
connected by a ventral nerve cord.
Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod. Insects and myriapods use a series of tubes (tracheae) that
branch through the body, ending in minute tracheoles. These fine respiratory tubes perform gas exchangedirectlybetween the
air and cells within the organism. The major tracheae open to the surface of the cuticle via apertures calledspiracles.We should
note that these tracheal systems of ventilation have evolved independently in hexapods, myriapods, and arachnids. Although the
tracheal system works extremely well in terrestrial environments, it also works well in freshwater aquatic environments: In fact,
numerous species of aquatic insects in both immature and adult stages possess tracheal systems. However, although there are
insects that live on the surface of marine environments, none is strictly marine—meaning that they complete their entire
metamorphosisinsalt water.
In contrast, aquatic crustaceans utilize gills, terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs, and aquatic chelicerates use book gills
(Figure 28.37). The book lungs of arachnids (scorpions, spiders, ticks, and mites) contain a vertical stack of hemocoel wall tissue
that somewhat resembles the pages of a book. Between each of the "pages" of tissue is an air space. This allows both sides of the
tissue to be in contact with the air at all times, greatly increasing the efficiency of gas exchange. The gills of crustaceans are
filamentous structures that exchange gases with the surrounding water.
Thecuticleis the hard “covering” of an arthropod. It is made up of two layers: theepicuticle, which is a thin, waxy, water-
resistant outer layer containing no chitin, and the layer beneath it, thechitinous procuticle, which itself is composed of an
exocuticleand a lowerendocuticle, all supported ultimately by abasement membrane. The exoskeleton is very protective (it is
sometimes difficult to squish a big beetle!), but does not sacrifice flexibility or mobility. Both the exocuticle (which is secreted
beforea molt), and an endocuticle, (which is secretedaftera molt), are composed of chitin bound with a protein; chitin is
insoluble in water, alkalis, and weak acids. The procuticle is not only flexible and lightweight, but also provides protection
against dehydration and other biological and physical stresses. Some hexapods, such as the crustaceans, add calcium salts to
their exoskeleton, which increases the strength of the cuticle, but does reduce its flexibility. In some cases, such as lobsters, the
amount of calcium salt deposited within the chitin is extreme. In order to grow, the arthropod must “shed” the exoskeleton
during the physiological process calledmolting, following by the actual stripping of the outer cuticle, calledecdysis(“to strip

Most chelicerates ingest food using a preoral cavity formed by the chelicerae and pedipalps. Some chelicerates may secrete
digestive enzymes to pre-digest food before ingesting it. Parasitic chelicerates like ticks and mites have evolved blood-sucking
apparatuses. Members of this subphylum have an open circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood into the hemocoel.
Aquatic species, like horseshoe crabs, have gills, whereas terrestrial species have either tracheae or book lungs for gaseous
exchange. Chelicerate hemolymph contains hemocyanin a copper-containing oxygen transport protein.
Figure28.39Spider. The trapdoor spider, like all spiders, is a member of the subphylum Chelicerata. (credit: Marshal Hedin)
The nervous system in chelicerates consists of a brain and two ventral nerve cords. Chelicerates are dioecious, meaning that the
sexes are separate. These animals use external fertilization as well as internal fertilization strategies for reproduction,
depending upon the species and its habitat. Parental care for the young ranges from absolutely none to relatively prolonged
care.

appendages. (credit b: modification of work by Nicholas W. Beeson)
In most crustaceans, the head and thorax is fused to form acephalothorax(Figure 28.43), which is covered by a plate called the
carapace, thus producing a body plan comprising two tagmata:cephalophoraxandabdomen. Crustaceans have a chitinous
exoskeleton that is shed by molting and ecdysis whenever the animal requires an increase in size or the next stage of
development. The exoskeletons of many aquatic species are also infused with calcium carbonate, which makes them even
stronger than those of other arthropods. Crustaceans have an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the hemocoel
by the dorsally located heart. Hemocyanin is the major respiratory pigment present in crustaceans, but hemoglobin is found in a
few species and both are dissolved in the hemolymph rather than carried in cells.
Figure28.43Crustacean anatomy. The crayfish is an example of a crustacean. It has a carapace around the cephalothorax and the heart in
the dorsal thorax area. (credit: Jane Whitney)
As in the chelicerates, most crustaceans are dioecious. However, some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites.Serial
hermaphroditism, where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova, is also exhibited in some species. Fertilized eggs
may be held within the female of the species or may be released in the water. Terrestrial crustaceans seek out damp spaces in
their habitats to lay eggs.
Larval stages—nauplius or zoea—are seen in the early development of aquatic crustaceans. A cypris larva is also seen in the early
development of barnacles (Figure 28.44).

reaching a size that would have allowed them the capacity for gliding or actual flapping flight. Even modern insects with broadly
attached wings, such as butterflies, use the basal one-third of their wings (the area next to the thorax) for thermoregulation, and
the outer two-thirds for flight, camouflage, and mate selection.
Many of the common insects we encounter on a daily basis—including ants, beetles, cockroaches, butterflies, crickets and
flies—are examples of Hexapoda. Among these, adult ants, beetles, flies, and butterflies develop by complete metamorphosis
from grub-like or caterpillar-like larvae, whereas adult cockroaches and crickets develop through a gradual or incomplete
metamorphosis from wingless immatures. All growth occurs during the juvenile stages. Adults do not grow further (but may
become larger) after their final molt. Variations in wing, leg, and mouthpart morphology all contribute to the enormous variety
seen in the insects. Insect variability was also encouraged by their activity as pollinators and their coevolution with flowering
plants. Some insects, especially termites, ants, bees, and wasps, are eusocial, meaning that they live in large groups with
individuals assigned to specific roles or castes, like queen, drone, and worker. Social insects usepheromones—external
chemical signals—to communicate and maintain group structure as well as a cohesive colony.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:

• Describe the distinguishing characteristics of chordates
The phyla Echinodermata and Chordata (the phylum that includes humans) both belong to the superphylum Deuterostomia.
Recall that protostomes and deuterostomes differ in certain aspects of their embryonic development, and they are named based
on which opening of thearchenteron(primitive gut tube) develops first. The word deuterostome comes from the Greek word
meaning “mouth second,” indicating that the mouth develops as a secondary structure opposite the location of the blastopore,
which becomes the anus. In protostomes (“mouth first”), the first embryonic opening becomes the mouth, and the second
opening becomes the anus.

• Superphylum Deuterostomia 769
Some cells are glandular, and may produce toxins. Each arm or section of the animal contains several different structures: for
example, digestive glands, gonads, and the tube feet that are unique to the echinoderms. In echinoderms like sea stars, every
arm bears two rows oftube feeton the oral side, running along an external ambulacral groove. These tube feet assist in
locomotion, feeding, and chemical sensations, as well as serve to attach some species to the substratum.
Figure28.47Anatomy of a sea star. This diagram of a sea star shows the pentaradial pattern typical of adult echinoderms, and the water
vascular system that is their defining characteristic.
Water Vascular and Hemal Systems
Echinoderms have a uniqueambulacral (water vascular) system, derived from part of thecoelom, or “body cavity.” The water
vascular system consists of a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm. Each radial canal is connected to a
double row oftube feet, which project through holes in the endoskeleton, and function as tactile and ambulatory structures.
These tube feet can extend or retract based on the volume of water present in the system of that arm, allowing the animal to
move and also allowing it to capture prey with their suckerlike action. Individual tube feet are controlled by bulblikeampullae.
Seawater enters the system through anaboral madreporite(opposite the oral area where the mouth is located) and passes to the
ring canal through a shortstone canal. Water circulating through these structures facilitates gaseous exchange and provides a
hydrostatic source for locomotion and prey manipulation. Ahemal system, consisting of oral, gastric, and aboral rings, as well
as other vessels running roughly parallel to the water vascular system, circulates nutrients. Transport of nutrients and gases is
shared by the water vascular and hemal systems in addition to the visceral body cavity that surrounds the major organs.
Nervous System
The nervous system in these animals is a relatively simple, comprising a circumoral nerve ring at the center and five radial
nerves extending outward along the arms. In addition, several networks of nerves are located in different parts of the body.
However, structures analogous to a brain or large ganglia are not present in these animals. Depending on the group,
echinoderms may have well-developed sensory organs for touch and chemoreception (e.g., within the tube feet and on tentacles
at the tips of the arms), as well as photoreceptors and statocysts.
Digestive and Excretory Systems
A mouth, located on the oral (ventral) side, opens through a short esophagus to a large, baglike stomach. The so-called “cardiac”
stomach can be everted through the mouth during feeding (for example, when a starfish everts its stomach into a bivalve prey
item to digest the animal—alive—within its own shell!) There are masses of digestive glands (pyloric caeca) in each arm,
running dorsally along the arms and overlying the reproductive glands below them. After passing through the pyloric caeca in
each arm, the digested food is channeled to a small anus, if one exists.
Podocytes—cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids—are present near the center of the echinoderm disc, at the
junction of the water vascular and hemal systems. These podocytes are connected by an internal system of canals to the

Phylum Chordata
Animals in the phylum Chordata share five key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal

The vertebrates exhibit two major innovations in their evolution from the invertebrate chordates. These
innovations may be associated with the whole genome duplications that resulted in a quadruplication of the
basic chordate genome, including theHoxgene loci that regulate the placement of structures along the three
axes of the body. One of the first major steps was the emergence of the quadrupeds in the form of the
amphibians. A second step was the evolution of the amniotic egg, which, similar to the evolution of pollen

strengthened with glycoproteins similar to cartilage and covered with a collagenous sheath. The notocord is located between the
digestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides rigid skeletal support as well as a flexible location for attachment of axial
muscles. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal’s lifetime.
However, in vertebrates (craniates), the notochord is present only during embryonic development, at which time it induces the
development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not
found in the postembryonic stages of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (that is, the spine).
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure29.3Chordate features. In chordates, four common features appear at some point during development: a notochord, a dorsal
hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. The endostyle is embedded in the floor of the pharynx.
Which of the following statements about common features of chordates is true?
1. The dorsal hollow nerve cord is part of the chordate central nervous system.
2. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits become the gills.
3. Humans are not chordates because humans do not have a tail.
4. Vertebrates do not have a notochord at any point in their development; instead, they have a vertebral column.
5. The endostyle secretes steroid hormones.
Thedorsal hollow nerve cordis derived from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development. In chordates, it is
located dorsally to the notochord. In contrast, the nervous system in protostome animal phyla is characterized by solid nerve
cords that are located either ventrally and/or laterally to the gut. In vertebrates, the neural tube develops into the brain and
spinal cord, which together comprise the central nervous system (CNS). The peripheral nervous system (PNS) refers to the
peripheral nerves (including the cranial nerves) lying outside of the brain and spinal cord.
Pharyngeal slitsare openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment. In
organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding.
Some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth. The endostyle is a
strip of ciliated mucus-producing tissue in the floor of the pharynx. Food particles trapped in the mucus are moved along the
endostyle toward the gut. The endostyle also produces substances similar to thyroid hormones and is homologous with the
thyroid gland in vertebrates. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, into
jaw supports. In tetrapods (land vertebrates), the slits are highly modified into components of the ear, and tonsils and thymus
glands. In other vertebrates, pharyngeal arches, derived from all three germ layers, give rise to the oral jaw from the first
pharyngeal arch, with the second arch becoming the hyoid and jaw support.
Thepost-anal tailis a posterior elongation of the body, extending beyond the anus. The tail contains skeletal elements and
muscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species, such as fishes. In some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail also
helps with balance, courting, and signaling when danger is near. In humans and other great apes, the post-anal tail is reduced
to a vestigial coccyx (“tail bone”) that aids in balance during sitting.

Adult tunicates may be either solitary or colonial forms, and some species may reproduce by budding. Most tunicates live a
sessile existence on the ocean floor and aresuspension feeders. However, chains of thaliacean tunicates calledsalps(Figure 29.6)
can swim actively while feeding, propelling themselves as they move water through the pharyngeal slits. The primary foods of
tunicates are plankton and detritus. Seawater enters the tunicate’s body through its incurrent siphon. Suspended material is
filtered out of this water by a mucous net produced by the endostyle and is passed into the intestine via the action of cilia. The
anus empties into the excurrent siphon, which expels wastes and water. Tunicates are found in shallow ocean waters around the
world.

them separately only for convenience. Further, we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes, theAgnatha,
although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes (the hagfishes) and vertebrate jawless
fishes (the lampreys).
Animals that possess jaws are known asgnathostomes, which means “jawed mouth.” Gnathostomes include fishes and
tetrapods.Tetrapodliterally means “four-footed,” which refers to the phylogenetic history of various land vertebrates, even
though in some of the tetrapods, the limbs may have been modified for purposes other than walking. Tetrapods include
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, and technically could also refer to the extinct fishlike groups that gave rise to the
tetrapods. Tetrapods can be further divided into two groups: amphibians and amniotes. Amniotes are animals whose eggs
contain four extraembryonic membranes (yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois) that provide nutrition and a water-retaining
environment for their embryos. Amniotes are adapted for terrestrial living, and include mammals, reptiles, and birds.

## Section 522.2
Fishes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the difference between jawless and jawed fishes
• Discuss the distinguishing features of sharks and rays compared to other modern fishes
Modern fishes include an estimated 31,000 species, by far the most of all clades within the Vertebrata. Fishes were the earliest
vertebrates, with jawless species being the earliest forms and jawed species evolving later. They are active feeders, rather than
sessile, suspension feeders. The Agnatha (jawless fishes)—the hagfishes and lampreys—have a distinct cranium and complex
sense organs including eyes, that distinguish them from the invertebrate chordates, the urochordates and cephalochordates.
Jawless Fishes: Superclass Agnatha
Jawless fishes (Agnatha) are craniates representing an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over 550 million years ago. In the
past, hagfishes and lampreys were sometimes recognized as separate clades within the Agnatha, primarily because lampreys
were regarded as true vertebrates, whereas hagfishes were not. However, recent molecular data, both from rRNA and mtDNA,
as well as embryological data, provide strong support for the hypothesis that living agnathans—previously called
cyclostomes—are monophyletic, and thus share recent common ancestry. The discussion below, for convenience, separates the
modern “cyclostomes” into the class Myxini and class Petromyzontida. The defining features of the living jawless fishes are the
lack of jaws and lack of paired lateral appendages (fins). They also lack internal ossification and scales, although these are not
defining features of the clade.
Some of the earliest jawless fishes were the armored ostracoderms (which translates to “shell-skin”): vertebrate fishes encased in
bony armor—unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales. Some ostracoderms, also unlike living jawless
fishes, may have had paired fins. We should note, however, that the “ostracoderms” represent an assemblage of heavily armored
extinct jawless fishes that may not form a natural evolutionary group. Fossils of the genusHaikouichthysfrom China, with an
age of about 530 million years, show many typical vertebrate characteristics including paired eyes, auditory capsules, and
rudimentary vertebrae.
Class Myxini: Hagfishes
The classMyxiniincludes at least 70 species of hagfishes—eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on living or
dead invertebrates, fishes, and marine mammals (Figure 29.9). Although they are almost completely blind, sensory barbels
around the mouth help them locate food by smell and touch. They feed using keratinized teeth on a movable cartilaginous plate
in the mouth, which rasp pieces of flesh from their prey. These feeding structures allow the gills to be used exclusively for
respiration,notfor filter feeding as in the urochordates and cephalochordates. Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in
oceans around the world, except for the polar regions. Unique slime glands beneath the skin release a milky mucus (through
surface pores) that upon contact with water becomes incredibly slippery, making the animal almost impossible to hold. This
slippery mucus thus allows the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. Hagfish can also twist their bodies into a knot,
which provides additional leverage to feed. Sometimes hagfish enter the bodies of dead animals and eat carcasses from the
inside out! Interestingly, they do not have a stomach!

Gnathostomes: Jawed Fishes
Gnathostomes, or “jaw-mouths,” are vertebrates that possess true jaws—a milestone in the evolution of the vertebrates. In fact,
one of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw: a hinged structure
attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food. Jaws were probably derived from the first pair of gill
arches supporting the gills of jawless fishes.
Early gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins, allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately. Pectoral fins are typically
located on the anterior body, and pelvic fins on the posterior. Evolution of the jaw and paired fins permitted gnathostomes to
expand their food options from the scavenging and suspension feeding of jawless fishes to active predation. The ability of
gnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources probably contributed to their replacing most jawless fishes during the Devonian
period. Two early groups of gnathostomes were theacanthodiansandplacoderms(Figure 29.11), which arose in the late Silurian
period and are now extinct. Most modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes
(which include the class Actinoptertygii and class Sarcopterygii).
Figure29.11A placoderm.Dunkleosteuswas an enormous placoderm from the Devonian period, 380 to 360 million years ago. It
measured up to 10 meters in length and weighed up to 3.6 tons. Its head and neck were armored with heavy bony plates. Although
Dunkleosteushad no true teeth, the edge of the jaw was armed with sharp bony blades. (credit: Nobu Tamura)
Class Chondrichthyes: Cartilaginous Fishes
The class Chondrichthyes (about 1,000 species) is a morphologically diverse clade, consisting of subclass Elasmobranchii (sharks
[Figure 29.12], rays, and skates, together with the obscure and critically endangered sawfishes), and a few dozen species of
fishes calledchimaeras, or “ghost sharks” in the subclass Holocephali. Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins
and a skeleton made of cartilage. This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian. They are
thought to be descended from the placoderms, which had endoskeletons made of bone; thus, the lighter cartilaginous skeleton
of Chondrichthyes is a secondarily derived evolutionary development. Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of
calcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone.
Most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives. Most
sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces.
Sharks have abrasive skin covered with tooth-like scales called placoid scales. Shark teeth probably evolved from rows of these
scales lining the mouth. A few species of sharks and rays, like the enormous whale shark (Figure 29.13), are suspension feeders
that feed on plankton. The sawfishes have an extended rostrum that looks like a double-edged saw. The rostrum is covered with
electrosensitive pores that allow the sawfish to detect slight movements of prey hiding in the muddy sea floor. The teeth in the
rostrum are actually modified tooth-like structures called denticles, similar to scales.

In general, the Chondrichthyes have a fusiform or dorsoventrally flattened body, aheterocercalcaudal fin or tail (unequally sized
fin lobes, with the tail vertebrae extending into the larger upper lobe) paired pectoral and pelvic fins (in males these may be
modified as claspers), exposed gill slits (elasmobranch), and an intestine with a spiral valve that condenses the length of the
intestine. They also have three pairs of semicircular canals, and excellent senses of smell, vibration, vision, and electroreception.
A very large lobed liver producessqualene oil(a lightweight biochemical precursor to steroids) that serves to aid in buoyancy
(because with a specific gravity of 0.855, it is lighter than that of water).
Rays and skates comprise more than 500 species. They are closely related to sharks but can be distinguished from sharks by their
flattened bodies, pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head, and gill slits on their ventral surface (Figure 29.15). Like
sharks, rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton. Most species are marine and live on the sea floor, with nearly a worldwide
distribution.
Unlike the stereotypical sharks and rays, the Holocephali (chimaeras or ratfish) have adiphycercaltail (equally sized fin lobes,
with the tail vertebrae located between them), lack scales (lost secondarily in evolution), and have teeth modified as grinding
plates that are used to feed on mollusks and other invertebrates (Figure 29.15b). Unlike sharks with elasmobranch or naked gills,
chimaeras have four pairs of gills covered by an operculum. Many species have a pearly iridescence and are extremely pretty.

existence today.

• Distinguish between the characteristics of Urodela, Anura, and Apoda
• Describe the evolutionary history of amphibians
Amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods (“four limbs”), and include frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. The term “amphibian”
loosely translates from the Greek as “dual life,” which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs and salamanders
undergo and the unique mix of aquatic and terrestrial phases that are required in their life cycle. In fact, they cannot stray far
from water because their reproduction is intimately tied to aqueous environments. Amphibians evolved during the Devonian
period and were the earliest terrestrial tetrapods. They represent an evolutionary transition from water to land that occurred
over many millions of years. Thus, the Amphibia are the only living true vertebrates that have made a transition from water to
land in both their ontogeny (life development) and phylogeny (evolution). They have not changed much in morphology over the
past 350 million years!

Characteristics of Amphibians
As tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs. In some species of salamanders, hindlimbs are
reduced or absent, but all caecilians are (secondarily) limbless. An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist,
permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands. Most water is taken in across the skin rather than by drinking. The skin is also
one of three respiratory surfaces used by amphibians. The other two are the lungs and the buccal (mouth) cavity. Air is taken first
into the mouth through the nostrils, and then pushed by positive pressure into the lungs by elevating the throat and closing the
nostrils.
All extant adult amphibians are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue used to capture prey.
Amphibians also have multiple small teeth at the edge of the jaws. In salamanders and caecilians, teeth are present in both jaws,
sometimes in multiple rows. In frogs and toads, teeth are seen only in the upper jaw. Additional teeth, calledvomerine teeth,
may be found in the roof of the mouth. Amphibian teeth arepedicellate, which means that the root and crown are calcified,
separated by a zone of noncalcified tissue.
Amphibians have image-forming eyes and color vision. Ears are best developed in frogs and toads, which vocalize to
communicate. Frogs use separate regions of the inner ear for detecting higher and lower sounds: thepapilla amphibiorum,
which is sensitive to frequencies below 10,000 hertz and unique to amphibians, and thepapilla basilaris, which is sensitive to
higher frequencies, including mating calls, transmitted from the eardrum through the stapes bone. Amphibians also have an
extra bone in the ear, the operculum, which transmits low-frequency vibrations from the forelimbs and shoulders to the inner
ear, and may be used for the detection of seismic signals.
Evolution of Amphibians
The fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods: now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago.
Evolution of tetrapods from lobe-finned freshwater fishes (similar to coelacanths and lungfish) represented a significant change
in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water, to organisms that breathed air and moved onto
land; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period.
Aquatic tetrapods of the Devonian period includeIchthyostegaandAcanthostega. Both were aquatic, and may have had both
gills and lungs. They also had four limbs, with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods, including
amphibians. However, the limbs could not be pulled in under the body and would not have supported their bodies well out of
water. They probably lived in shallow freshwater environments, and may have taken brief terrestrial excursions, much like
“walking” catfish do today in Florida. InIchthyostega, the forelimbs were more developed than the hind limbs, so it might have
dragged itself along when it ventured onto land. What precededAcanthostegaandIchthyostega?
In 2006, researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a “tetrapod-like fish,”Tiktaalik roseae, which seems to be a
morphologically “intermediate form” between sarcopterygian fishes having feet-like fins and early tetrapods having true limbs
(Figure 29.17).Tiktaaliklikely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago.2Tiktaalik also had gills and
lungs, but the loss of some gill elements gave it a neck, which would have allowed its head to move sideways for feeding. The eyes
were on top of the head. It had fins, but the attachment of the fin bones to the shoulder suggested they might be weight-
bearing. Tiktaalik precededAcanthostegaandIchthyostega, with their four limbs, by about 10 million years and is considered to
be a true intermediate clade between fish and amphibians.

groups of vertebrates, with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica. Anurans, ranging
from the minute New Guinea frog at 7 mm to the huge goliath frog at 32 cm from tropical Africa, have a body plan that is more
specialized for movement. Adult frogs use their hind limbs and their arrow-like endoskeleton to jump accurately to capture prey
on land. Tree frogs have hands adapted for grasping branches as they climb. In tropical areas, “flying frogs” can glide from perch
to perch on the extended webs of their feet. Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including
skin that acts as camouflage. Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals that are poisonous to
predators from glands in the skin. Frogs with more toxic skins have bright warning (aposematic) coloration.
Figure29.19Tree frog. The Australian green tree frog is a nocturnal predator that lives in the canopies of trees near a water source.
Frog eggs are fertilized externally, and like other amphibians, frogs generally lay their eggs in moist environments. Although
amphibian eggs are protected by a thick jelly layer, they would still dehydrate quickly in a dry environment. Frogs demonstrate a
great diversity of parental behaviors, with some species laying many eggs and exhibiting little parental care, to species that carry
eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or embedded in their backs. The males of Darwin's frog carry tadpoles in their vocal sac.
Many tree frogs lay their eggs off the ground in a folded leaf located over water so that the tadpoles can drop into the water as
they hatch.
The life cycle of most frogs, as other amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to
an adult stage. However, the eggs of frogs in the genusEleutherodactylusdevelop directly into little froglets, guarded by a
parent. The larval stage of a frog, the tadpole, is often a filter-feeding herbivore. Tadpoles usually have gills, a lateral line system,

Figure29.21Paleozoic continents. During the Paleozoic Era, around 550 million years ago, the continent Gondwana formed. Both
Gondwana and the continent Laurentia were located near the equator.
During the early Paleozoic, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was much greater than it is today. This may have
begun to change later, as land plants became more common. As the roots of land plants began to infiltrate rock and soil began to
form, carbon dioxide was drawn out of the atmosphere and became trapped in the rock. This reduced the levels of carbon
dioxide and increased the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, so that by the end of the Paleozoic, atmospheric conditions were
similar to those of today.
As plants became more common through the latter half of the Paleozoic, microclimates began to emerge and ecosystems began
to change. As plants and ecosystems continued to grow and become more complex, vertebrates moved from the water to land.
The presence of shoreline vegetation may have contributed to the movement of vertebrates onto land. One hypothesis suggests
that the fins of aquatic vertebrates were used to maneuver through this vegetation, providing a precursor to the movement of
fins on land and the further development of limbs. The late Paleozoic was a time of diversification of vertebrates, as amniotes
emerged and became two different lines that gave rise, on one hand, to synapsids and mammals, and, on the other hand, to the
codonts, reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds. Many marine vertebrates became extinct near the end of the Devonian period, which
ended about 360 million years ago, and both marine and terrestrial vertebrates were decimated by a mass extinction in the early
Permian period about 250 million years ago.

The reptiles (including dinosaurs and birds) are distinguished from amphibians by their terrestrially adapted egg, which is

Evolution of Amniotes
The first amniotes evolved from tetrapod ancestors approximately 340 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. The
early amniotes quickly diverged into two main lines:synapsidsandsauropsids.Synapsidsincluded thetherapsids, a clade from
which mammals evolved.Sauropsidswere further divided intoanapsidsanddiapsids. Diapsids gave rise to the reptiles,
including the dinosaurs and birds. The key differences between the synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids are the structures of the
skull and the number oftemporal fenestrae(“windows”) behind each eye (Figure 29.23).Temporal fenestraeare post-orbital
openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen. Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae, synapsids have one
(fused ancestrally from two fenestrae), and diapsids have two (although many diapsids such as birds have highly modified
diapsid skulls). Anapsids include extinct organisms and traditionally included turtles. However, more recent molecular and
fossil evidence clearly shows that turtles arose within the diapsid line and secondarily lost the temporal fenestrae; thus they
appear to be anapsids because modern turtles do not have fenestrae in the temporal bones of the skull. The canonical diapsids
include dinosaurs, birds, and all other extinct and living reptiles.
Figure29.23Amniote skulls. Compare the skulls and temporal fenestrae of anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids. Anapsids have no openings,
synapsids have one opening, and diapsids have two openings.
The diapsids in turn diverged into two groups, theArchosauromorpha(“ancient lizard form”) and theLepidosauromorpha
(“scaly lizard form”) during the Mesozoic period (Figure 29.24). Thelepidosaursinclude modern lizards, snakes, and tuataras.
Thearchosaursinclude modern crocodiles and alligators, and the extinct ichthyosaurs (“fish lizards” superficially resembling
dolphins), pterosaurs (“winged lizard”), dinosaurs (“terrible lizard”), and birds. (We should note that clade Dinosauria includes
birds, which evolved from a branch of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs in the Mesozoic.)
The evolutionarily derived characteristics of amniotes include the amniotic egg and its four extraembryonic membranes, a
thicker and more waterproof skin, and rib ventilation of the lungs (ventilation is performed by drawing air into and out of the
lungs by muscles such as the costal rib muscles and the diaphragm).

running. Some squamates can supplement rib movement with buccal pumping through the nose, with the mouth closed. In
crocodilians, the lung chamber is expanded and contracted by moving the liver, which is attached to the pelvis. Turtles have a
special problem with breathing, because their rib cage cannot expand. However, they can change the pressure around the lungs
by pulling their limbs in and out of the shell, and by moving their internal organs. Some turtles also have a posterior respiratory
sac that opens off the hindgut that aids in the diffusion of gases.
Most reptiles areectotherms, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment; however, some
crocodilians maintain elevatedthoracictemperatures and thus appear to be at least regionalendotherms. This is in contrast to
true endotherms, which use heat produced by metabolism and muscle contraction to regulate body temperature over a very
narrow temperature range, and thus are properly referred to ashomeotherms. Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help
regulate body temperature, such as basking in sunny places to warm up through the absorption of solar radiation, or finding
shady spots or going underground to minimize the absorption of solar radiation, which allows them to cool down and prevent
overheating. The advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body; therefore, reptiles
can survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm. In cold weather, some reptiles such as
the garter snakebrumate.Brumationis similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long
periods without eating, but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves. Rather,
their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures, and the animal is very sluggish.
Evolution of Reptiles
Reptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. One of the oldest known amniotes is
Casineria, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. One of the earliest undisputed reptile fossils was
Hylonomus, a lizardlike animal about 20 cm long. Soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three
groups—synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids—during the Permian period. The Permian period also saw a second major
divergence of diapsid reptiles into stem archosaurs (predecessors of thecodonts, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds) and
lepidosaurs (predecessors of snakes and lizards). These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period, when the
archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group possibly due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during
the Permian-Triassic extinction. About 250 million years ago, archosaurs radiated into the pterosaurs and both saurischian
“lizard hip” and ornithischian “bird-hip” dinosaurs (see below).
Although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs, thepterosaurswere distinct from true dinosaurs (Figure 29.25).
Pterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight, including hollow bones (birds also exhibit hollow bones, a case
of convergent evolution). Their wings were formed by membranes of skin that attached to the long, fourth finger of each arm
and extended along the body to the legs.

soar after launching from cliffs. (credit: Mark Witton, Darren Naish)

Dinosaurs dominated the Mesozoic era, which was known as the “Age of Reptiles.” The dominance of dinosaurs lasted until the
end of the Cretaceous, the last period of the Mesozoic era. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction resulted in the loss of most of the
large-bodied animals of the Mesozoic era. Birds are the only living descendants of one of the major clades of theropod
dinosaurs.

Modern Reptiles
Class Reptilia includes many diverse species that are classified into four living clades. There are the 25 species of Crocodilia, two
species of Sphenodontia, approximately 9,200 Squamata species, and about 325 species of Testudines.
Crocodilia
Crocodilia(“small lizard”) arose as a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic; extant species include alligators, crocodiles,
gharials, and caimans. Crocodilians (Figure 29.27) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa, South America, Southern
Florida, Asia, and Australia. They are found in freshwater, saltwater, and brackish habitats, such as rivers and lakes, and spend
most of their time in water. Crocodiles are descended from terrestrial reptiles and can still walk and run well on land. They often
move on their bellies in a swimming motion, propelled by alternate movements of their legs. However, some species can lift
their bodies off the ground, pulling their legs in under the body with their feet rotated to face forward. This mode of locomotion
takes a lot of energy, and seems to be used primarily to clear ground obstacles. Amazingly, some crocodiles can also gallop,
pushing off with their hind legs and moving their hind and forelegs alternately in pairs. Galloping crocodiles have been clocked
at speeds over 17 kph and, over short distances, in an ambush situation, they can easily chase down most humans if they are
taken by surprise. However, they are short distance runners, not interested in a long chase, and most fit humans can probably
outrun them in a sprint (assuming they respond quickly to the ambush!).

Figure29.29A chameleon. This Jackson’s chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii) blends in with its surroundings.
Most lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs, although these have often been lost or significantly reduced in at least 60
lineages. Snakes lack eyelids and external ears, which are both present in lizards. There are about 6,000 species of lizards,
ranging in size from tiny chameleons and geckos, some of which are only a few centimeters in length, to the Komodo dragon,
which is about 3 meters in length.
Some lizards are extravagantly decorated with spines, crests, and frills, and many are brightly colored. Some lizards, like
chameleons (Figure 29.29), can change their skin color by redistributing pigment withinchromatophoresin their skins.
Chameleons change color both for camouflage and for social signaling. Lizards have multiple-colored oil droplets in their retinal
cells that give them a good range of color vision. Lizards, unlike snakes, can focus their eyes by changing the shape of the lens.
The eyes of chameleons can move independently. Several species of lizards have a "hidden"parietal eye, similar to that in the
tuatara. Both lizards and snakes use their tongues to sample the environment and a pit in the roof of the mouth, Jacobson's
organ, is used to evaluate the collected sample.
Most lizards are carnivorous, but some large species, such as iguanas, are herbivores. Some predatory lizards are ambush
predators, waiting quietly until their prey is close enough for a quick grab. Others are patient foragers, moving slowly through
their environment to detect possible prey. Lizard tongues are long and sticky and can be extended at high speed for capturing
insects or other small prey. Traditionally, the only venomous lizards are the Gila monster and the beaded lizard. However,
venom glands have also been identified in several species of monitors and iguanids, but the venom is not injected directly and
should probably be regarded as a toxin delivered with the bite.
Specialized features of the jaw are related to adaptations for feeding that have evolved to feed on relatively large prey (even
though some current species have reversed this trend). Snakes are thought to have descended from either burrowing or aquatic
lizards over 100 million years ago (Figure 29.30). They include about 3,600 species, ranging in size from 10 centimeter-long
thread snakes to 10 meter-long pythons and anacondas. All snakes are legless, except for boids (e.g., boa constrictors), which
have vestigial hindlimbs in the form ofpelvic spurs. Like caecilian amphibians, the narrow bodies of most snakes have only a
single functional lung. All snakes are carnivorous and eat small animals, birds, eggs, fish, and insects.

## Section 532.2
Birds
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the evolutionary history of birds
• Describe the derived characteristics in birds that facilitate flight
With over 10,000 identified species, the birds are the most speciose of the land vertebrate classes. Abundant research has shown
that birds are really an extant clade that evolved from maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs about 150 million years ago. Thus, even
though the most obvious characteristic thatseemsto set birds apart from other extant vertebrates is the presence of feathers,
we now know that feathers probably appeared in the common ancestor of both ornithischian and saurischian lineages of
dinosaurs. Feathers in these clades are also homologous to reptilian scales and mammalian hair, according to the most recent
research. While the wings of vertebrates like bats function without feathers, birds rely on feathers, and wings, along with other
modifications of body structure and physiology, for flight, as we shall see.
Characteristics of Birds
Birds are endothermic, and more specifically,homeothermic—meaning that they usually maintain an elevated and constant
body temperature, which is significantly above the average body temperature of most mammals. This is, in part, due to the fact
that active flight—especially the hovering skills of birds such as hummingbirds—requires enormous amounts of energy, which
in turn necessitates a high metabolic rate. Like mammals (which are also endothermic and homeothermic and covered with an
insulating pelage), birds have several different types of feathers that together keep “heat” (infrared energy) within the core of the
body, away from the surface where it can be lost by radiation and convection to the environment.
Modern birds produce two main types of feathers:contour feathersanddown feathers.Contour feathershave a number of
parallelbarbsthat branch from acentral shaft. The barbs in turn have microscopic branches calledbarbulesthat are linked
together by minute hooks, making the vane of a feather a strong, flexible, and uninterrupted surface. In contrast, the barbules
ofdown feathersdo not interlock, making these feathers especially good for insulation, trapping air in spaces between the
loose, interlocking barbules of adjacent feathers to decrease the rate of heat loss by convection and radiation. Certain parts of a
bird’s body are covered in down feathers, and the base of other feathers has a downy portion, whereas newly hatched birds are
covered almost entirely in down, which serves as an excellent coat of insulation, increasing thethermal boundary layerbetween
the skin and the outside environment.
Feathers not only provide insulation, but also allow for flight, producing the lift and thrust necessary for flying birds to become
and stay airborne. The feathers on a wing areflexible,so the feathers at the end of the wing separate as air moves over them,
reducing the drag on the wing. Flight feathers are also asymmetrical and curved, so that air flowing over them generates lift.
Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings,primary feathersandsecondary feathers(Figure 29.32).Primary feathers
are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust as the bird moves its wings downward, using the pectoralis major muscles.

Figure29.33Pneumatic bone. Many birds have hollow, pneumatic bones, which make flight easier.
Other modifications that reduce weight include the lack of a urinary bladder. Birds possess acloaca, an external body cavity into
which the intestinal, urinary, and genital orifices empty in reptiles, birds, and the monotreme mammals. The cloaca allows
water to be reabsorbed from waste back into the bloodstream. Thus, uric acid isnoteliminated as a liquid but is concentrated
intourate salts, which are expelled along with fecal matter. In this way, water is not held in a urinary bladder, which would
increase body weight. In addition, the females of most bird species only possess one functional (left) ovary rather than two,
further reducing body mass.
The respiratory system of birds is dramatically different from that of reptiles and mammals, and is well adapted for the high
metabolic rate required for flight. To begin, the air spaces of pneumatic bone are sometimes connected toair sacsin the body
cavity, which replace coelomic fluid and also lighten the body. These air sacs are also connected to the path of airflow through
the bird's body, and function in respiration. Unlike mammalian lungs in which air flows in two directions, as it is breathed in
and out, diluting the concentration of oxygen, airflow through bird lungs is unidirectional (Figure 29.34). Gas exchange occurs
in "air capillaries" or microscopic air passages within the lungs. The arrangement of air capillaries in the lungs creates a counter-
current exchange system with the pulmonary blood. In a counter-current system, the air flows in one direction and the blood
flows in the opposite direction, producing a favorable diffusion gradient and creating an efficient means of gas exchange. This
very effective oxygen-delivery system of birds supports their higher metabolic activity. In effect, ventilation is provided by the
parabronchi(minimally expandible lungs) with thin air sacs located among the visceral organs and the skeleton. Asyrinx(voice
box) resides near the junction of the trachea and bronchi. The syrinx, however, isnothomologous to the mammalian larynx,
which resides within the upper part of the trachea.
Figure29.34Air flow in bird lungs. Avian respiration is an efficient system of gas exchange with air flowingunidirectionally. A full ventilation
cycle takes two breathing cycles. During the first inhalation, air passes from the trachea into posterior air sacs, then during the first
exhalation into the lungs. The second inhalation moves the air in the lungs to the anterior air sacs, and the second exhalation moves the air
in the anterior air sacs out of the body. Overall, each inhalation moves air into the air sacs, while each exhalation moves fresh air through
the lungs and "used" air out of the body. The air sacs are connected to the hollow interior of bones. (credit: modification of work by L.
Shyamal)
Beyond the unique characteristics discussed above, birds are also unusual vertebrates because of a number of other features.
First, they typically have an elongate (very “dinosaurian”) S-shaped neck, but a short tail orpygostyle, produced from the fusion
of the caudal vertebrae. Unlike mammals, birds have only one occipital condyle, allowing them extensive movement of the head
and neck. They also have a very thin epidermis without sweat glands, and a specializeduropygial glandor sebaceous “preening
gland” found at the dorsal base of the tail. This gland is an essential topreening(a virtually continuous activity) in most birds
because it produces an oily substance that birds use to help waterproof their feathers as well as keep them flexible for flight. A

The Evolution of Flight in Birds
There are two basic hypotheses that explain how flight may have evolved in birds: thearboreal (“tree”) hypothesisand the
terrestrial (“land”) hypothesis. Thearboreal hypothesisposits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from
branch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight. In contrast to this, the
terrestrial hypothesisholds that running (perhaps pursuing active prey such as small cursorial animals) was the stimulus for
flight. In this scenario, wings could be used to capture prey and were preadapted for balance and flapping flight. Ostriches,
which are large flightless birds, hold their wings out when they run, possibly for balance. However, this condition may represent
a behavioral relict of the clade of flying birds that were their ancestors. It seems more likely that small feathered arboreal
dinosaurs, were capable of gliding (and flapping) from tree to tree and branch to branch, improving the chances of escaping
enemies, finding mates, and obtaining prey such as flying insects. This early flight behavior would have also greatly increased
the opportunity for species dispersal.
Although we have a good understanding of how feathers and flight may have evolved, the question of how endothermy evolved
in birds (and other lineages) remains unanswered. Feathers provide insulation, but this is only beneficial forthermoregulatory
purposesif body heat is being produced internally. Similarly, internal heat production is only viable for the evolution of
endothermy ifinsulation is presentto retain that infrared energy. It has been suggested that one or the other—feathers or
endothermy—evolved first in response to some other selective pressure (e.g., the ability to be active at night, provide
camouflage, repel water, or serve as signals for mate selection). It seems probable that feathers and endothermy coevolved
together, the improvement and evolutionary advancement of feathers reinforcing the evolutionary advancement of endothermy,
and so on.
During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 MYA), a group known as the Enantiornithes was the dominant bird type (Figure 29.36).
Enantiornithes means “opposite birds,” which refers to the fact that certain bones of the shoulder are joined differently than the
way the bones are joined in modern birds. LikeArchaeopteryx, these birds retained teeth in their jaws, but did have a shortened
tail, and at least some fossils have preserved “fans” of tail feathers. These birds formed an evolutionary lineage separate from
that of modern birds, and they did not survive past the Cretaceous. Along with the Enantiornithes, however, another group of
birds—the Ornithurae ("bird tails"), with a short, fused tail orpygostyle—emerged from the evolutionary line that includes
modern birds. This clade was also present in the Cretaceous.
After the extinction of Enantiornithes, theOrnithuraebecame the dominant birds, with a large and rapid radiation occurring
after the extinction of the dinosaurs during the Cenozoic era (66 MYA to the present). Molecular analysis based on very large
data sets has produced our current understanding of the relationships among living birds. There are three major clades: the
Paleognathae, the Galloanserae, and the Neoaves. The Paleognathae (“old jaw”) or ratites (polyphyletic) are a group of flightless
birds including ostriches, emus, rheas, and kiwis. The Galloanserae include pheasants, ducks, geese and swans. The Neoaves
("new birds") includes all other birds. The Neoaves themselves have been distributed among five clades:3Strisores (nightjars,
swifts, and hummingbirds), Columbaves (turacos, bustards, cuckoos, pigeons, and doves), Gruiformes (cranes),
Aequorlitornithes (diving birds, wading birds, and shorebirds), and Inopinaves (a very large clade of land birds including hawks,
owls, woodpeckers, parrots, falcons, crows, and songbirds). Despite the current classification scheme, it is important to
understand that phylogenetic revisions, even for the extant birds, are still taking place.

Characteristics of Mammals
The presence ofhair, composed of the proteinkeratin, is one of the most obvious characteristics of mammals. Although it is not
very extensive or obvious on some species (such as whales), hair has many important functions for most mammals. Mammals
are endothermic, and hair traps a boundary layer of air close to the body, retaining heat generated by metabolic activity. Along
with insulation, hair can serve as a sensory mechanism via specialized hairs calledvibrissae, better known as whiskers.
Vibrissae attach to nerves that transmit information about tactile vibration produced by sound sensation, which is particularly
useful to nocturnal or burrowing mammals. Hair can also provide protective coloration or be part of social signaling, such as
when an animal’s hair stands “on end” to warn enemies, or possibly to make the mammal “look bigger” to predators.
Unlike the skin of birds, the integument (skin) of mammals, includes a number of different types of secretory glands.Sebaceous
glandsproduce a lipid mixture calledsebumthat is secreted onto the hair and skin, providing water resistance and lubrication
for hair. Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body.Eccrine glandsproduce sweat, or perspiration, which is mainly
composed of water, but also contains metabolic waste products, and sometimes compounds with antibiotic activity. In most
mammals, eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body, and some mammals do not possess them at all. However, in
primates, especially humans, sweat glands are located over most of the body surface and figure prominently in regulating the
body temperature through evaporative cooling.Apocrine glands, orscent glands, secrete substances that are used for chemical
communication, such as in skunks.Mammary glandsproduce milk that is used to feed newborns. In both monotremes and
eutherians, both males and females possess mammary glands, while in marsupials, mammary glands have been found only in
some opossums. Mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or eccrine glands, but their evolutionary origin is not entirely
clear.
The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features. The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone, the
dentary, and the jaw hinge connects the dentary to the squamosal (flat) part of the temporal bone in the skull. The jaws of other
vertebrates are composed of several bones, including the quadrate bone at the back of the skull and the articular bone at the
back of the jaw, with the jaw connected between the quadrate and articular bones. In the ear of other vertebrates, vibrations are
transmitted to the inner ear by a single bone, thestapes. In mammals, the quadrate and articular bones have moved into the
middle ear (Figure 29.37). The malleus is derived from the articular bone, whereas the incus originated from the quadrate bone.
This arrangement of jaw and ear bones aids in distinguishing fossil mammals from fossils of other synapsids.
Figure29.37Mammalian ear bones. Bones of the mammalian middle ear are modified from bones of the jaw and skull in reptiles. The
stapes is found in other vertebrates (e.g., the columella of birds) whereas in mammals, the malleus and incus are derived from the articular
and quadrate bones, respectively. (credit: NCI)
The adductor muscles that close the jaw comprise two major muscles in mammals: thetemporalisand themasseter. Working
together, these muscles permit up-and-down and side-to-side movements of the jaw, making chewing possible—which is
unique to mammals. Most mammals haveheterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth
(incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) rather than just one type and shape of tooth. Most mammals are alsodiphyodonts,
meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or “baby” teeth, and permanent teeth. Most other
vertebrates with teeth arepolyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life.
Mammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart; however, the hearts of birds and mammals are an example of convergent

masseter muscles, which close the jaw and function in chewing.
In the appendicular skeleton, the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates in that it does
not possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle, and the scapula is the dominant bone.
Mammals evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early Jurassic
period, some 205 million years ago. One group of transitional mammals was themorganucodonts, small nocturnal insectivores.
The jaws of morganucodonts were “transitional,” with features of both reptilian and mammalian jaws (Figure 29.39). Like
modern mammals, the morganucodonts had differentiated teeth and were diphyodonts. Mammals first began to diversify in the
Mesozoic era, from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods. Even some small gliding mammals appear in the fossil record during
this time period. However, most of the Jurassic mammals were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic. During the Cretaceous
period, another radiation of mammals began and continued through the Cenozoic era, about 65 million years ago.

Living Mammals
There are three major groups of living mammals:monotremes(prototheria),marsupials(metatheria), andplacental(eutheria)
mammals. The eutherians and the marsupials together comprise a clade of therian mammals, with the monotremes forming a
sister clade to both metatherians and eutherians.
There are very few living species ofmonotremes: the platypus and four species of echidnas, or spiny anteaters. The leathery-
beaked platypus belongs to the familyOrnithorhynchidae(“bird beak”), whereas echidnas belong to the familyTachyglossidae
(“sticky tongue”) (Figure 29.40). The platypus and one species of echidna are found in Australia, and the other species of echidna
are found in New Guinea. Monotremes are unique among mammals because they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to live
young. The shells of their eggs are not like the hard shells of birds, but have a leathery shell, similar to the shells of reptile eggs.
Monotremes retain their eggs through about two-thirds of the developmental period, and then lay them in nests. A yolk-sac
placenta helps support development. The babies hatch in a fetal state and complete their development in the nest, nourished by
milk secreted by mammary glands opening directly to the skin. Monotremes, except for young platypuses, do not have teeth.
Body temperature in the three monotreme species is maintained at about 30°C, considerably lower than the average body
temperature of marsupial and placental mammals, which are typically between 35 and 38°C.

in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1
ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular
interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species.
Characteristics of Primates
All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. This arboreal heritage of
primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for climbing, or brachiation (swinging through trees using the arms).
These adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other
toes (except humans) and thumbs sufficiently separated from fingers to allow for gripping branches, and 3)stereoscopic vision,
two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. Other
characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into
flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.
Order Primates is divided into two groups: Strepsirrhini (“turned-nosed”) and Haplorhini (“simple-nosed”) primates.
Strepsirrhines, also called the wet-nosed primates, include prosimians like the bush babies and pottos of Africa, the lemurs of
Madagascar, and the lorises of Southeast Asia. Haplorhines, or dry-nosed primates, include tarsiers (Figure 29.42) and simians
(New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). In general, strepsirrhines tend to be nocturnal, have larger
olfactory centers in the brain, and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids. Haplorhines, with a few
exceptions, are diurnal, and depend more on their vision. Another interesting difference between the strepsirrhines and
haplorhines is that strepsirrhines have the enzymes for making vitamin C, while haplorhines have to get it from their food.
Figure29.42A Philippine tarsier. This tarsier,Carlito syrichta, is one of the smallest primates—about 5 inches long, from nose to the base of
the tail. The tail is not shown, but is about twice the length of the body. Note the large eyes, each of which is about the same size as the
animal's brain, and the long hind legs. (credit: mtoz (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0(http://openstax.org/l/CCSA_2)), via

Evolution of Primates
The first primate-like mammals are referred to as proto-primates. They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size
and appearance. The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented. These proto-primates remain
largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. Although genetic evidence suggests that primates
diverged from other mammals about 85 MYA, the oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record date
to about 65 MYA. Fossils like the proto-primatePlesiadapis(although some researchers do not agree thatPlesiadapiswas a
proto-primate) had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. They were found in North America
and Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.
The first true primates date to about 55 MYA in the Eocene epoch. They were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
These early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. Evolutionary changes continued in these early

The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes; they have low sexual dimorphism (that is, the sexes are not markedly
different in size), although in some species, the sexes differ in color; and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging
through trees (Figure 29.45a). Two species of orangutan are native to different islands in Indonesia: Borneo (P. pygmaeus) and
Sumatra (P. abelii). A third orangutan species,Pongo tapanuliensis, was reported in 2017 from the Batang Toru forest in
Sumatra. Orangutans are arboreal and solitary. Males are much larger than females and have cheek and throat pouches when
mature. Gorillas all live in Central Africa. The eastern and western populations are recognized as separate species,G. berengei
andG. gorilla. Gorillas are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males about twice the size of females. In older males, called
silverbacks, the hair on the back turns white or gray. Chimpanzees (Figure 29.45b) are the species considered to be most closely
related to humans. However, the species most closely related to the chimpanzee is the bonobo. Genetic evidence suggests that
chimpanzee and human lineages separated 5 to 7 MYA, while chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus) lineages
separated about 2 MYA. Chimpanzees and bonobos both live in Central Africa, but the two species are separated by the Congo
River, a significant geographic barrier. Bonobos are slighter than chimpanzees, but have longer legs and more hair on their
heads. In chimpanzees, white tail tufts identify juveniles, while bonobos keep their white tail tufts for life. Bonobos also have
higher-pitched voices than chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are more aggressive and sometimes kill animals from other groups,
while bonobos are not known to do so. Both chimpanzees and bonobos are omnivorous. Orangutan and gorilla diets also include
foods from multiple sources, although the predominant food items are fruits for orangutans and foliage for gorillas.

Human Evolution
The family Hominidae of order Primates includes the hominoids: the great apes and humans (Figure 29.46). Evidence from the
fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a
common hominoid ancestor approximately six million years ago. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that
includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. The term hominin is used to refer to those species that
evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to
chimpanzees. A number of marker features differentiate humans from the other hominoids, including bipedalism or upright
posture, increase in the size of the brain, and a fully opposable thumb that can touch the little finger. Bipedal hominins include
several groups that were probably part of the modern human lineage—Australopithecus,Homo habilis, andHomo
erectus—and several non-ancestral groups that can be considered “cousins” of modern humans, such as Neanderthals and
Denisovans.
Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been
recovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of
evolution from early hominins to modern humans. In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it
is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named)
represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.

evolved from a common ancestor shared withAustralopithecusabout two million years ago (after likely passing through some
transitional states).Australopithecushad a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern
humans. For example, sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans. Males were up to 50 percent larger
than females, a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans. In contrast, modern human males are
approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females. The brain size ofAustralopithecusrelative to its body mass was also smaller
than in modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes. A key feature thatAustralopithecushad in common
with modern humans was bipedalism, although it is likely thatAustralopithecusalso spent time in trees. Hominin footprints,
similar to those of modern humans, were found in Laetoli, Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago. They showed that
hominins at the time ofAustralopithecuswere walking upright.
There were a number ofAustralopithecusspecies, which are often referred to asaustralopiths.Australopithecus anamensislived

afarensis(Figure 29.47a) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes, but these were larger than those of modern
humans. Its brain size was 380 to 450 cubic centimeters, approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain. It also had
prognathic jaws, which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans. In the mid-1970s, the fossil of an adult femaleA.
afarensiswas found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago (Figure 29.48). The fossil, which is
informally called “Lucy,” is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found, with 40 percent of the skeleton
recovered.

H.erectusappeared approximately 1.8 million years ago (Figure 29.49). It is believed to have originated in East Africa and was
the first hominin species to migrate out of Africa. Fossils ofH.erectushave been found in India, China, Java, and Europe, and
were known in the past as “Java Man” or “Peking Man.”H.erectushad a number of features that were more similar to modern
humans than those ofH.habilis.H.erectuswas larger in size than earlier hominins, reaching heights up to 1.85 meters and
weighing up to 65 kilograms, which are sizes similar to those of modern humans. Its degree of sexual dimorphism was less than
in earlier species, with males being 20 to 30 percent larger than females, which is close to the size difference seen in our own
species.H.erectushad a larger brain than earlier species at 775 to 1,100 cubic centimeters, which compares to the 1,130 to 1,260
cubic centimeters seen in modern human brains.H.erectusalso had a nose with downward-facing nostrils similar to modern
humans, rather than the forward-facing nostrils found in other primates. Longer, downward-facing nostrils allow for the
warming of cold air before it enters the lungs and may have been an adaptation to colder climates. Artifacts found with fossils of
H.erectussuggest that it was the first hominin to use fire, hunt, and have a home base.H.erectusis generally thought to have
lived until about 50,000 years ago.
Figure29.49Homo erectus. Homo erectushad a prominent brow and a nose that pointed downward rather than forward.
Humans:Homo sapiens
A number of species, sometimes called archaicHomo sapiens, apparently evolved fromH.erectusstarting about 500,000 years
ago. These species includeHomo heidelbergensis,Homo rhodesiensis, andHomo neanderthalensis. These archaicH.sapiens
had a brain size similar to that of modern humans, averaging 1,200 to 1,400 cubic centimeters. They differed from modern
humans by having a thick skull, a prominent brow ridge, and a receding chin. Some of these species survived until 30,000 to
10,000 years ago, overlapping with modern humans (Figure 29.50).

meristemsfacilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant.Intercalary meristemsoccur only in monocots, at the
bases of leaf blades and at nodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem). This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase
in length from the leaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing.
Meristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue. Such cells take on specific roles
and lose their ability to divide further. They differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue.Dermal
tissuecovers and protects the plant, andvascular tissuetransports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of the plant.
Ground tissueserves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps to store water
and sugars.
Secondary tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types). Dermal tissue,
for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. Vascular tissue is an example
of a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue transports water and
nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel elements and tracheids
(both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma. Phloem tissue, which transports organic compounds from the site of
photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which conduct photosynthates),
companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. Unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem conducting cells are alive at
maturity. The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other (Figure 30.3). In stems, the xylem and the phloem form a
structure called avascular bundle; in roots, this is termed thevascular steleorvascular cylinder.
Figure30.3This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash (Curcurbita maxima) stem. Each teardrop-shaped vascular bundle
consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside. Xylem cells, which transport water and
nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant, are dead at functional maturity. Phloem cells, which transport sugars and other organic
compounds from photosynthetic tissue to the rest of the plant, are living. The vascular bundles are encased in ground tissue and
surrounded by dermal tissue. (credit: modification of work by "(biophotos)"/Flickr; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)

Stems are a part of the shoot system of a plant. They may range in length from a few millimeters to hundreds of meters, and also
vary in diameter, depending on the plant type. Stems are usually above ground, although the stems of some plants, such as the
potato, also grow underground. Stems may be herbaceous (soft) or woody in nature. Their main function is to provide support to

cells. Vascular tissue composed of xylem (red) and phloem tissue (green, between the xylem and cortex) surrounds the pith. (credit: Rolf-

Collenchyma cellsare elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls (Figure 30.6). They provide structural support, mainly to the
stem and leaves. These cells are alive at maturity and are usually found below the epidermis. The “strings” of a celery stalk are an
example of collenchyma cells.

Sclerenchyma cellsalso provide support to the plant, but unlike collenchyma cells, many of them are dead at maturity. There are
two types of sclerenchyma cells: fibers and sclereids. Both types have secondary cell walls that are thickened with deposits of
lignin, an organic compound that is a key component of wood. Fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are smaller-sized.
Sclereids give pears their gritty texture. Humans use sclerenchyma fibers to make linen and rope (Figure 30.7).

Vascular Tissue
The xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called vascular bundles,
which run up and down the length of the stem. When the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot stems are
arranged in a ring. In plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together and produce the
characteristic growth rings. In monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the ground tissue
(Figure 30.9).
Figure30.9In (a) dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue. The xylem tissue is located toward
the interior of the vascular bundle, and phloem is located toward the exterior. Sclerenchyma fibers cap the vascular bundles. In (b) monocot
stems, vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are scattered throughout the ground tissue.
Xylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements. The latter two types conduct water and
are dead at maturity.Tracheidsare xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified. Water moves from one tracheid
to another through regions on the side walls known as pits, where secondary walls are absent.Vessel elementsare xylem cells
with thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids. Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate
at the end walls of the element. Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant.

Gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus encouraging the axillary buds
to grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.

growth at high speed.
Secondary Growth
The increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are
lacking in herbaceous plants. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see
Figure 30.10). The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem. The
cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and secondary
phloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due
to the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of cork cambium, which
forms the tough outermost layer of the stem. The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which provides hardiness and
strength.
In woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance
known as suberin that can repel water. The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss. The
cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. The cork cambium,
cork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed theperiderm. The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants. In
some plants, the periderm has many openings, known aslenticels, which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the
outside atmosphere (Figure 30.11). This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex, xylem, and
phloem.

Annual Rings
The activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. During the spring growing season, cells of the secondary
xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. This is known as early wood, or
spring wood. During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late wood, or autumn wood,
which is denser than early wood. This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of

Roots
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify the two types of root systems
• Describe the three zones of the root tip and summarize the role of each zone in root growth
• Describe the structure of the root
• List and describe examples of modified roots
The roots of seed plants have three major functions: anchoring the plant to the soil, absorbing water and minerals and
transporting them upwards, and storing the products of photosynthesis. Some roots are modified to absorb moisture and
exchange gases. Most roots are underground. Some plants, however, also haveadventitious roots, which emerge above the
ground from the shoot.
Types of Root Systems
Root systems are mainly of two types (Figure 30.15). Dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root system. A
tap root systemhas a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise. Dandelions are a
good example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow another shoot from the
remaining root. A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil. In contrast, afibrous root systemis located closer to the soil
surface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion (lawn grasses are a good example, as are wheat,
rice, and corn). Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots. Plants that grow in dry areas often have deep
root systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems.

epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption.Root hairs, which are extensions of root epidermal cells, increase the
surface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals.
Inside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith (Figure 30.17). Compared to stems, roots have lots
of cortex and little pith. Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products. The cortex is between the epidermis and
the vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root.
Figure30.17Staining reveals different cell types in this light micrograph of a wheat (Triticum) root cross section. Sclerenchyma cells of the
exodermis and xylem cells stain red, and phloem cells stain blue. Other cell types stain black. The stele, or vascular tissue, is the area
inside endodermis (indicated by a green ring). Root hairs are visible outside the epidermis. (credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root, which is called thestele(Figure 30.18). A layer of cells
known as theendodermisseparates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root. The endodermis is
exclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root’s vascular system. A waxy substance called suberin
is present on the walls of the endodermal cells. This waxy region, known as theCasparian strip, forces water and solutes to cross
the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells. This ensures that only materials required by
the root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded. The outermost cell layer of
the root’s vascular tissue is thepericycle, an area that can give rise to lateral roots. In dicot roots, the xylem and phloem of the
stele are arranged alternately in an X shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith.

Leaves are the main sites for photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize food. Most leaves are usually green, due to
the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells. However, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant pigments that
mask the green chlorophyll.
The thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment. Each variation helps a plant species maximize its
chances of survival in a particular habitat. Usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface areas
than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to minimize water
loss.

Structure of a Typical Leaf
Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called thelamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the
plant stem by apetiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are calledsessileleaves.
Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known asstipules. Most leaves have a midrib, which travels
the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is called the margin.
Figure 30.21shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.
Figure30.21Deceptively simple in appearance, a leaf is a highly efficient structure.
Within each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called thevenationpattern. Monocots and
dicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 30.22). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across
the length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming
a pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, theGinkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork.

The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick; however, in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions, the epidermis may
be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration. A waxy layer known as thecuticlecovers the
leaves of all plant species. The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have small hairs
(trichomes) on the leaf surface. Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing toxic or bad-
tasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface (Figure 30.25).

Below the epidermis of dicot leaves are layers of cells known as the mesophyll, or “middle leaf.” The mesophyll of most leaves
typically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells: the palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma (Figure 30.26). The
palisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may be present in one,
two, or three layers. Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape. These are the cells of the
spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange
between the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. In aquatic plants, the intercellular spaces in the spongy
parenchyma help the leaf float. Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts. Guard cells are the only epidermal cells
to contain chloroplasts.

Leaf Adaptations
Coniferous plant species that thrive in cold environments, like spruce, fir, and pine, have leaves that are reduced in size and
needle-like in appearance. These needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid in
reducing water loss. In hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination with their
succulent stems, help to conserve water. Many aquatic plants have leaves with wide lamina that can float on the surface of the
water, and a thick waxy cuticle on the leaf surface that repels water.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Plant Adaptations in Resource-Deficient Environments
Roots, stems, and leaves are structured to ensure that a plant can obtain the required sunlight, water, soil nutrients, and oxygen
resources. Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to thrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or
more of these resources is in short supply.
In tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much of the sunlight from
reaching the forest floor. Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to maximize the capture of sunlight. Other
species are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve as a physical support. Such plants are able to grow high up in
the canopy atop the branches of other trees, where sunlight is more plentiful. Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in
the branches and leaves of the supporting plant. Bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples
of tropical epiphytes (Figure 30.28). Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently capture and store
water.

Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define water potential and explain how it is influenced by solutes, pressure, gravity, and the matric potential
• Describe how water potential, evapotranspiration, and stomatal regulation influence how water is
transported in plants
• Explain how photosynthates are transported in plants
The structure of plant roots, stems, and leaves facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates throughout the
plant. The phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement. Water potential, evapotranspiration, and
stomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants. To understand how these processes work, we
must first understand the energetics of water potential.
Water Potential
Plants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers. Using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential
energy, plants can move water to the top of a 116-meter-tall tree (Figure 30.31a). Plants can also use hydraulics to generate
enough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks (Figure 30.31b). Plants achieve this because of water potential.

decrease in Ψ . The internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water because of the cytoplasm’s high
total
solute content (Figure 30.32). Because of this difference in water potential water will move from the soil into a plant’s root cells
via the process of osmosis. This is why solute potential is sometimes called osmotic potential.
Plant cells can metabolically manipulate Ψ (and by extension, Ψ ) by adding or removing solute molecules. Therefore, plants

VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure30.32In this example with a semipermeable membrane between two aqueous systems, water will move from a region of higher to
lower water potential until equilibrium is reached. Solutes (Ψ s), pressure (Ψ p), and gravity (Ψ g) influence total water potential for each side
of the tube (Ψ total right or left), and therefore, the difference between Ψ totalon each side (ΔΨ). (Ψ m, the potential due to interaction of water
with solid substrates, is ignored in this example because glass is not especially hydrophilic). Water moves in response to the difference in
water potential between two systems (the left and right sides of the tube).
Positive water potential is placed on the left side of the tube by increasing Ψ such that the water level rises on the right side.
p
Could you equalize the water level on each side of the tube by adding solute, and if so, how?
Pressure Potential
Pressure potential (Ψ ), also called turgor potential, may be positive or negative (Figure 30.32). Because pressure is an
p
expression of energy, the higher the pressure, the more potential energy in a system, and vice versa. Therefore, a positive Ψp
(compression) increases Ψ , and a negative Ψ (tension) decreases Ψ . Positive pressure inside cells is contained by the cell

wall, producing turgor pressure. Pressure potentials are typically around 0.6–0.8 MPa, but can reach as high as 1.5 MPa in a
well-watered plant. A Ψ of 1.5 MPa equates to 210 pounds per square inch (1.5 MPa x 140 lb/in-2MPa-1= 210 lb/in-2). As a

comparison, most automobile tires are kept at a pressure of 30–34 psi. An example of the effect of turgor pressure is the wilting
of leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered (Figure 30.33). Water is lost from the leaves via transpiration
(approaching Ψ = 0 MPa at the wilting point) and restored by uptake via the roots.

photosynthesis. The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the cells evaporates
into the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells. This decrease creates a greater tension on the
water in the mesophyll cells (Figure 30.34), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem vessels. The xylem vessels and
tracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure. Rings in the vessels maintain their tubular shape,
much like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure. Small perforations between vessel
elements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called cavitation. The formation of gas bubbles
in xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the plant, causing a break termed an embolism in
the flow of xylem sap. The taller the tree, the greater the tension forces needed to pull water, and the more cavitation events. In
larger trees, the resulting embolisms can plug xylem vessels, making them nonfunctional.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure30.34The cohesion–tension theory of sap ascent is shown. Evaporation from the mesophyll cells produces a negative water
potential gradient that causes water to move upwards from the roots through the xylem.
Which of the following statements is false?
a. Negative water potential draws water into the root hairs. Cohesion and adhesion draw water up the xylem. Transpiration
draws water from the leaf.
b. Negative water potential draws water into the root hairs. Cohesion and adhesion draw water up the phloem. Transpiration
draws water from the leaf.
c. Water potential decreases from the roots to the top of the plant.
d. Water enters the plants through root hairs and exits through stoma.
Transpiration—the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata—is a passive process, meaning that metabolic
energy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement. The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy
between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere. However, transpiration is tightly controlled.

Xerophytes and epiphytes often have a thick covering of trichomes or of stomata that are sunken below the leaf’s surface.
Trichomes are specialized hair-like epidermal cells that secrete oils and substances. These adaptations impede air flow across
the stomatal pore and reduce transpiration. Multiple epidermal layers are also commonly found in these types of plants.
Transportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem
Plants need an energy source to grow. In seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by
metabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants. Once green shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to
produce their own food by photosynthesizing. The products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually in
the form of simple sugars such as sucrose.
Structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to assources. Sugars produced in sources, such as
leaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process calledtranslocation. The points of sugar
delivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are calledsinks. Seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a source or a
sink, depending on the plant’s stage of development and the season.
The products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem. For example, the highest leaves
will send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward to the
roots. Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the flow in the xylem, which is always unidirectional (soil
to leaf to atmosphere). The pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops. Photosynthates are directed
primarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and fruits during reproductive
development. They are also directed to tubers for storage.
Translocation: Transport from Source to Sink
Photosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves. From there they are
translocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored. Mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels called
plasmodesmata. Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (STEs) in the vascular
bundles. From the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem STEs. The sucrose is actively transported
against its concentration gradient (a process requiring ATP) into the phloem cells using the electrochemical potential of the
proton gradient. This is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-H+symporter.
Phloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressure-driven
bulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap. Companion cells are associated with STEs. They assist with metabolic activities and
produce energy for the STEs (Figure 30.36).
Figure30.36Phloem is comprised of cells called sieve-tube elements. Phloem sap travels through perforations called sieve tube plates.

• Describe thigmotropism, thigmonastism, and thigmogenesis

Animals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location. Plants, however, are rooted in place and must
respond to the surrounding environmental factors. Plants have sophisticated systems to detect and respond to light, gravity,
temperature, and physical touch. Receptors sense environmental factors and relay the information to effector systems—often
through intermediate chemical messengers—to bring about plant responses.
Plant Responses to Light
Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low-molecular-weight
sugars using only carbon dioxide, light, and water.Photomorphogenesisis the growth and development of plants in response
to light. It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space.Photoperiodismis the ability to use light to track time. Plants

can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight.Phototropismis a directional
response that allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light.
The sensing of light in the environment is important to plants; it can be crucial for competition and survival. The response of
plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light-absorbing
pigment called achromophore. Together, the two are called a chromoprotein.
The red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants. Sensory
photoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available in
the daylight spectrum. In terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the spectrum.
As light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the far-red end,
shifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light. Blue-light receptors allow plants to
gauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in blue–green emissions. Water absorbs red light, which makes
the detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants.
The Phytochrome System and the Red/Far-Red Response
Thephytochromesare a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole
light-absorbing head group of chlorophyll. Phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: Pr and Pfr. Pr absorbs red
light (~667nm) and is immediately converted to Pfr. Pfr absorbs far-red light (~730nm) and is quickly converted back to Pr.
Absorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation and
activity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound. Pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore, exposure
to red light yields physiological activity. Exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity. Together, the two forms
represent the phytochrome system (Figure 30.38).
The phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch. It monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of environmental
light. The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts the chromoprotein
to the inactive Pr form. Additionally, Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark, or break down over time. In all instances, the
physiological response induced by red light is reversed. The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) can directly activate other
molecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses specific gene
expression.
Once the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs. Unfiltered, full sunlight contains much
more red light than far-red light. Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in the
far-red region, any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched light.
The preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the Pr (inactive) form, slowing growth. The
nearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these areas sense the
red light, which activates the Pfr form and induces growth. In short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system to grow away
from shade and towards light. Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the evolutionary
advantages of the phytochrome system are obvious.
In seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded). Instead, is it
used merely to determine if there is any light at all. This is especially important in species with very small seeds, such as lettuce.
Because of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves. Their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run out of fuel. If
they germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight and would die. In
the dark, phytochrome is in the Pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate if exposed to light at
the surface of the soil. Upon exposure to light, Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds.

The Blue Light Responses
Phototropism—the directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light source—is a response to blue wavelengths of
light. Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source (Figure 30.39), while negative phototropism (also called
skototropism) is growth away from light.
The aptly-namedphototropinsare protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response. Like all plant
photoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore. In
phototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins called
flavoproteins.
Other responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of
stomata. However, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best
understood.
In their 1880 treatiseThe Power of Movements in Plants, Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described phototropism as the
bending of seedlings toward light. Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem), but
that the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant. They concluded that the signal had to travel from the
apical meristem to the base of the plant.
Figure30.39Azure bluets (Houstonia caerulea) display a phototropic response by bending toward the light. (credit: Cory Zanker)
In 1913, Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending at
the base. He cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip. The seedling
bent toward the light when illuminated. However, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and the cut
base, the seedling did not bend. A refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side of the
seedling. When the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light. Therefore, the
chemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded side than
on the illuminated side. We now know that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates phototropin
activation across the stem. Most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid (IAA) to
accumulate on the shaded side. Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.
Cryptochromesare another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.
Cryptochromes set the plants' 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues. There is some
evidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response.

and fruit and flower maturation. GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves, and seed embryos. In
urban areas, GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and reduce the frequency of
pruning.
GAs break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or light to
germinate. Abscisic acid is a strong antagonist of GA action. Other effects of GAs include gender expression, seedless fruit
development, and the delay of senescence in leaves and fruit. Seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods
and contain inconspicuous seeds that fail to develop. Because GAs are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development
and stem elongation are under GA control, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters.
Maturing grapes are routinely treated with GA to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which
reduces the instance of mildew infection (Figure 30.40).
Figure30.40In grapes, application of gibberellic acid increases the size of fruit and loosens clustering. (credit: Bob Nichols, USDA)
Abscisic Acid
The plant hormoneabscisic acid(ABA) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls.
However, more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process. ABA accumulates as a
response to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths. Its activity
counters many of the growth-promoting effects of GAs and auxins. ABA inhibits stem elongation and induces dormancy in
lateral buds.
ABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins. Plants adapted to
temperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate. This mechanism protects young plants
from sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter. As the hormone gradually breaks down over winter, the
seed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring. Another effect of ABA is to promote
the development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud. Low soil moisture
causes an increase in ABA, which causes stomata to close, reducing water loss in winter buds.

• Plant Sensory Systems and Responses 863
Defense Responses against Herbivores and Pathogens
Plants face two types of enemies: herbivores and pathogens. Herbivores both large and small use plants as food, and actively
chew them. Pathogens are agents of disease. These infectious microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes, live off
of the plant and damage its tissues. Plants have developed a variety of strategies to discourage or kill attackers.
The first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier. Bark and the waxy cuticle can protect against predators.
Other adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified leaves. They
discourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions. A plant’s exterior protection can be
compromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens. If the first line of defense is breached,
the plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes.
Secondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration or
plant growth and development. Many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them. Some
metabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or repellent
tastes (like the bitterness of quinine). Other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation (caffeine is one
example) or the lethargy associated with opioids. Some compounds become toxic after ingestion. For instance, glycol cyanide in
the cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion; the nearly 500 million humans who rely on cassava for nutrition must be
certain to process the root properly before eating.
Mechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at sites
farther from the injury location. Some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours. The infected and
surrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection.
Long-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator. As tissue is damaged, jasmonates may
promote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators. Jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds that
attract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their host.
The plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair.

Macronutrients and Micronutrients
The essential elements can be divided into two groups: macronutrients and micronutrients. Nutrients that plants require in
larger amounts are calledmacronutrients. About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients: carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. The first of these macronutrients, carbon
(C), is required to form carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other compounds; it is therefore present in all
macromolecules. On average, the dry weight (excluding water) of a cell is 50 percent carbon. As shown inFigure 31.3, carbon is a
key part of plant biomolecules.
Figure31.3Cellulose, the main structural component of the plant cell wall, makes up over thirty percent of plant matter. It is the most
abundant organic compound on earth.
The next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen (N); it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. Nitrogen is also used in the
synthesis of some vitamins. Hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many organic compounds, and also form
water. Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration; plants use oxygen to store energy in the form of ATP. Phosphorus (P), another
macromolecule, is necessary to synthesize nucleic acids and phospholipids. As part of ATP, phosphorus enables food energy to
be converted into chemical energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, light energy is converted into chemical energy
during photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration.Sulfur is part of

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a water-nutrient solution instead of soil. Since its advent, hydroponics has
developed into a growing process that researchers often use. Scientists who are interested in studying plant nutrient
deficiencies can use hydroponics to study the effects of different nutrient combinations under strictly controlled conditions.
Hydroponics has also developed as a way to grow flowers, vegetables, and other crops in greenhouse environments. You
might find hydroponically grown produce at your local grocery store. Today, many lettuces and tomatoes in your market
have been hydroponically grown.

## Section 575.2
The Soil
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how soils are formed
• Explain soil composition
• Describe a soil profile
Plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil, which serves as a natural medium for land plants.Soilis the outer loose layer
that covers the surface of Earth. Soil quality is a major determinant, along with climate, of plant distribution and growth. Soil
quality depends not only on the chemical composition of the soil, but also the topography (regional surface features) and the
presence of living organisms. In agriculture, the history of the soil, such as the cultivating practices and previous crops, modify
the characteristics and fertility of that soil.
Soil develops very slowly over long periods of time, and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on
mineral, rock, and organic compounds. Soils can be divided into two groups:organic soilsare those that are formed from
sedimentation and primarily composed of organic matter, while those that are formed from the weathering of rocks and are
primarily composed of inorganic material are calledmineral soils. Mineral soils are predominant in terrestrial ecosystems,
where soils may be covered by water for part of the year or exposed to the atmosphere.

# Chapter 576

## Section 576.1
• The Soil 877
Soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers; together, the vertical section of a
soil is called thesoil profile. Within the soil profile, soil scientists define zones called horizons. Ahorizonis a soil layer with
distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers. Five factors account for soil formation: parent
material, climate, topography, biological factors, and time.
Parent Material
The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is theparent material. Mineral soils form directly from the weathering
ofbedrock, the solid rock that lies beneath the soil, and therefore, they have a similar composition to the original rock. Other
soils form in materials that came from elsewhere, such as sand and glacial drift. Materials located in the depth of the soil are
relatively unchanged compared with the deposited material. Sediments in rivers may have different characteristics, depending
on whether the stream moves quickly or slowly. A fast-moving river could have sediments of rocks and sand, whereas a slow-
moving river could have fine-textured material, such as clay.
Climate
Temperature, moisture, and wind cause different patterns of weathering and therefore affect soil characteristics. The presence
of moisture and nutrients from weathering will also promote biological activity: a key component of a quality soil.
Topography
Regional surface features (familiarly called “the lay of the land”) can have a major influence on the characteristics and fertility of
a soil. Topography affects water runoff, which strips away parent material and affects plant growth. Steeps soils are more prone
to erosion and may be thinner than soils that are relatively flat or level.
Biological factors
The presence of living organisms greatly affects soil formation and structure. Animals and microorganisms can produce pores
and crevices, and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation. Plant secretions promote the
development of microorganisms around the root, in an area known as therhizosphere. Additionally, leaves and other material
that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition.
Time
Time is an important factor in soil formation because soils develop over long periods. Soil formation is a dynamic process.
Materials are deposited over time, decompose, and transform into other materials that can be used by living organisms or
deposited onto the surface of the soil.
Physical Properties of the Soil
Soils are named and classified based on their horizons. The soil profile has four distinct layers: 1) O horizon; 2) A horizon; 3) B
horizon, or subsoil; and 4) C horizon, or soil base (Figure 31.7). TheO horizonhas freshly decomposing organic
matter—humus—at its surface, with decomposed vegetation at its base. Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances
soil moisture retention. Topsoil—the top layer of soil—is usually two to three inches deep, but this depth can vary considerably.
For instance, river deltas like the Mississippi River delta have deep layers of topsoil. Topsoil is rich in organic material; microbial
processes occur there, and it is the “workhorse” of plant production. TheA horizonconsists of a mixture of organic material
with inorganic products of weathering, and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil. This horizon is typically darkly
colored because of the presence of organic matter. In this area, rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from
the surface. TheBhorizonis an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward, resulting in a dense layer in the
soil. In some soils, the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate. TheC horizon, or soil base, includes the
parent material, plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil. The parent material may be either
created in its natural place, or transported from elsewhere to its present location. Beneath the C horizon lies bedrock.

Soil Scientist
A soil scientist studies the biological components, physical and chemical properties, distribution, formation, and morphology of
soils. Soil scientists need to have a strong background in physical and life sciences, plus a foundation in mathematics. They may
work for federal or state agencies, academia, or the private sector. Their work may involve collecting data, carrying out research,
interpreting results, inspecting soils, conducting soil surveys, and recommending soil management programs.

Many soil scientists work both in an office and in the field. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA): “a
soil scientist needs good observation skills to analyze and determine the characteristics of different types of soils. Soil types are
complex and the geographical areas a soil scientist may survey are varied. Aerial photos or various satellite images are often
used to research the areas. Computer skills and geographic information systems (GIS) help the scientist to analyze the multiple
facets of geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and climate to discover the patterns left on the landscape.”1Soil scientists play
a key role in understanding the soil’s past, analyzing present conditions, and making recommendations for future soil-related
practices.

Nutritional Adaptations of Plants
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Understand the nutritional adaptations of plants
• Describe mycorrhizae
• Explain nitrogen fixation
Plants obtain food in two different ways. Autotrophic plants can make their own food from inorganic raw materials, such as
carbon dioxide and water, through photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight. Green plants are included in this group. Some
plants, however, are heterotrophic: they are totally parasitic and lacking in chlorophyll. These plants, referred to as holo-
parasitic plants, are unable to synthesize organic carbon and draw all of their nutrients from the host plant.

Mycorrhizae: The Symbiotic Relationship between Fungi and Roots
A nutrient depletion zone can develop when there is rapid soil solution uptake, low nutrient concentration, low diffusion rate, or
low soil moisture. These conditions are very common; therefore, most plants rely on fungi to facilitate the uptake of minerals
from the soil. Fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant roots, in which the fungi actually are integrated
into the physical structure of the root. The fungi colonize the living root tissue during active plant growth.
Through mycorrhization, the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals, such as zinc and copper, from the soil. The
fungus obtains nutrients, such as sugars, from the plant root (Figure 31.12). Mycorrhizae help increase the surface area of the
plant root system because hyphae, which are narrow, can spread beyond the nutrient depletion zone. Hyphae can grow into
small soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would otherwise be unavailable to the plant. The beneficial effect on the
plant is best observed in poor soils. The benefit to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by
plants. Mycorrhizae functions as a physical barrier to pathogens. It also provides an induction of generalized host defense
mechanisms, and sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi.
Figure31.12Root tips proliferate in the presence of mycorrhizal infection, which appears as off-white fuzz in this image. (credit:
modification of work by Nilsson et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2005)
There are two types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath
around the roots, called a mantle. Hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil, which increases the surface area
for water and mineral absorption. This type of mycorrhizae is found in forest trees, especially conifers, birches, and oaks.
Endomycorrhizae, also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, do not form a dense sheath over the root. Instead, the fungal mycelium is
embedded within the root tissue. Endomycorrhizae are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants.

Asymbiontis a plant in a symbiotic relationship, with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation. Fungi also
form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae (called lichens). Lichens can sometimes be seen as colorful
growths on the surface of rocks and trees (Figure 31.15). The algal partner (phycobiont) makes food autotrophically, some of
which it shares with the fungus; the fungal partner (mycobiont) absorbs water and minerals from the environment, which are
made available to the green alga. If one partner was separated from the other, they would both die.

• Describe the reproductive structures of a plant
• Describe the components of a complete flower
• Describe the development of microsporangium and megasporangium in gymnosperms
Sexual reproduction takes place with slight variations in different groups of plants. Plants have two distinct
stages in their lifecycle: the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage. The haploidgametophyteproduces
the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures. Fusion of the male and females
gametes forms the diploid zygote, which develops into thesporophyte. After reaching maturity, the diploid
sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid
gametophyte. The new gametophyte produces gametes, and the cycle continues. This is the alternation of
generations, and is typical of plant reproduction (Figure 32.2).

four parts is missing, the flower is known as incomplete. Flowers that contain both an androecium and a gynoecium are called
perfect, androgynous or hermaphrodites. There are two types of incomplete flowers: staminate flowers contain only an

Male Gametophyte (The Pollen Grain)
The male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther. In a plant’s male reproductive organs,
development of pollen takes place in a structure known as themicrosporangium(Figure 32.6). The microsporangia, which are
usually bilobed, are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains. These are found in the anther, which is at
the end of the stamen—the long filament that supports the anther.

Figure32.7Pollen develops from the microspore mother cells. The mature pollen grain is composed of two cells: the pollen tube cell and
the generative cell, which is inside the tube cell. The pollen grain has two coverings: an inner layer (intine) and an outer layer (exine). The
inset scanning electron micrograph showsArabidopsis lyratapollen grains. (credit “pollen micrograph”: modification of work by Robert R.
Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Each pollen grain has two coverings: theexine(thicker, outer layer) and theintine(Figure 32.7). The exine contains
sporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells. Sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under
unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage.
Female Gametophyte (The Embryo Sac)
While the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases. First, in
the process ofmegasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploidmegasporangium—an area of tissue in the ovules—undergoes
meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase,megagametogenesis, the surviving
haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the
megagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei—thepolar nuclei—move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid
central cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the
end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into theantipodalcells, which later degenerate. The nucleus closest to
the micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop intosynergidcells (Figure 32.8). The
synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. Once fertilization is complete, the
resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed.

Male Gametophyte
A male cone has a central axis on which bracts, a type of modified leaf, are attached. The bracts are known asmicrosporophylls
(Figure 32.10) and are the sites where microspores will develop. The microspores develop inside the microsporangium. Within
the microsporangium, cells known as microsporocytes divide by meiosis to produce four haploid microspores. Further mitosis
of the microspore produces two nuclei: the generative nucleus, and the tube nucleus. Upon maturity, the male gametophyte
(pollen) is released from the male cones and is carried by the wind to land on the female cone.

Female Gametophyte
The female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known asmegasporophylls(Figure 32.10) are present. In the female
cone, megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium. The megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to produce
four haploid megaspores. One of the megaspores divides to form the multicellular female gametophyte, while the others divide
to form the rest of the structure. The female gametophyte is contained within a structure called the archegonium.

Pollination and Fertilization
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe what must occur for plant fertilization
• Explain cross-pollination and the ways in which it takes place
• Describe the process that leads to the development of a seed
• Define double fertilization
In angiosperms,pollinationis defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or
another flower. In gymnosperms, pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone. Upon transfer, the
pollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm for fertilizing the egg. Pollination has been well studied since the time
of Gregor Mendel. Mendel successfully carried out self- as well as cross-pollination in garden peas while studying how
characteristics were passed on from one generation to the next. Today’s crops are a result of plant breeding, which employs
artificial selection to produce the present-day cultivars. A case in point is today's corn, which is a result of years of breeding that
started with its ancestor, teosinte. The teosinte that the ancient Mayans originally began cultivating had tiny seeds—vastly
different from today’s relatively giant ears of corn. Interestingly, though these two plants appear to be entirely different, the
genetic difference between them is miniscule.
Pollination takes two forms: self-pollination and cross-pollination.Self-pollinationoccurs when the pollen from the anther is
deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.Cross-pollinationis the transfer of pollen from
the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination occurs in
flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower’s
stigma. This method of pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for
pollinators.

• Pollination and Fertilization 901
Figure32.12Insects, such as bees, are important agents of pollination. (credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)
Many flies are attracted to flowers that have a decaying smell or an odor of rotting flesh. These flowers, which produce nectar,
usually have dull colors, such as brown or purple. They are found on the corpse flower or voodoo lily (Amorphophallus), dragon
arum (Dracunculus), and carrion flower (Stapleia,Rafflesia). The nectar provides energy, whereas the pollen provides protein.
Wasps are also important insect pollinators, and pollinate many species of figs.
Butterflies, such as the monarch, pollinate many garden flowers and wildflowers, which usually occur in clusters. These flowers
are brightly colored, have a strong fragrance, are open during the day, and have nectar guides to make access to nectar easier.
The pollen is picked up and carried on the butterfly’s limbs. Moths, on the other hand, pollinate flowers during the late
afternoon and night. The flowers pollinated by moths are pale or white and are flat, enabling the moths to land. One well-
studied example of a moth-pollinated plant is the yucca plant, which is pollinated by the yucca moth. The shape of the flower
and moth have adapted in such a way as to allow successful pollination. The moth deposits pollen on the sticky stigma for
fertilization to occur later. The female moth also deposits eggs into the ovary. As the eggs develop into larvae, they obtain food
from the flower and developing seeds. Thus, both the insect and flower benefit from each other in this symbiotic relationship.
The corn earworm moth and Gaura plant have a similar relationship (Figure 32.13).

Pollination by Bats
In the tropics and deserts, bats are often the pollinators of nocturnal flowers such as agave, guava, and morning glory. The
flowers are usually large and white or pale-colored; thus, they can be distinguished from the dark surroundings at night. The
flowers have a strong, fruity, or musky fragrance and produce large amounts of nectar. They are naturally large and wide-
mouthed to accommodate the head of the bat. As the bats seek the nectar, their faces and heads become covered with pollen,
which is then transferred to the next flower.

Figure32.18In angiosperms, one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the 2nzygote, and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the
3nendosperm. This is called a double fertilization.
After fertilization, the zygote divides to form two cells: the upper cell, or terminal cell, and the lower, or basal, cell. The division
of the basal cell gives rise to thesuspensor, which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue. The suspensor
provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo. The terminal cell also divides,
giving rise to a globular-shaped proembryo (Figure 32.19a). In dicots (eudicots), the developing embryo has a heart shape, due to
the presence of the two rudimentarycotyledons(Figure 32.19b). In non-endospermic dicots, such asCapsella bursa, the
endosperm develops initially, but is then digested, and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons. As the embryo and
cotyledons enlarge, they run out of room inside the developing seed, and are forced to bend (Figure 32.19c). Ultimately, the
embryo and cotyledons fill the seed (Figure 32.19d), and the seed is ready for dispersal. Embryonic development is suspended
after some time, and growth is resumed only when the seed germinates. The developing seedling will rely on the food reserves
stored in the cotyledons until the first set of leaves begin photosynthesis.

Figure32.20The structures of dicot and monocot seeds are shown. Dicots (left) have two cotyledons. Monocots, such as corn (right), have
one cotyledon, called the scutellum; it channels nutrition to the growing embryo. Both monocot and dicot embryos have a plumule that
forms the leaves, a hypocotyl that forms the stem, and a radicle that forms the root. The embryonic axis comprises everything between the
plumule and the radicle, not including the cotyledon(s).
What of the following statements is true?
a. Both monocots and dicots have an endosperm.
b. The radicle develops into the root.
c. The plumule is part of the epicotyl.
d. The endosperm is part of the embryo.
The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots. In monocots, such as corn and wheat,
the single cotyledon is called ascutellum; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue (xylem and
phloem). Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm. Upon germination, enzymes are secreted by thealeurone, a single
layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo. The enzymes degrade the stored
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature
strand to the developing embryo. Therefore, the scutellum can be seen to be an absorptive organ, not a storage organ.
The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo. Inendospermic dicots, the food reserves are
stored in the endosperm. During germination, the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the
enzymatically released food reserves, much like in monocots (monocots, by definition, also have endospermic seeds). Tobacco
(Nicotiana tabaccum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum) are examples of endospermic dicots. In
non-endospermic dicots, the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization, but the endosperm food
reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage. The two halves of a peanut seed (Arachis
hypogaea) and the split peas (Pisum sativum) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves.
The seed, along with the ovule, is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac. In dicots, the
seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as thetestaand inner coat known as thetegmen.
The embryonic axis consists of three parts: the plumule, the radicle, and the hypocotyl. The portion of the embryo between the
cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as thehypocotyl(hypocotyl means “below the cotyledons”). The embryonic
axis terminates in aradicle(the embryonic root), which is the region from which the root will develop. In dicots, the hypocotyls
extend above ground, giving rise to the stem of the plant. In monocots, the hypocotyl does not show above ground because
monocots do not exhibit stem elongation. The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the
epicotyl. Theplumuleis composed of the epicotyl, young leaves, and the shoot apical meristem.
Upon germination in dicot seeds, the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards. This shape is called
the plumule hook, and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark. Therefore, as the epicotyl pushes through the
tough and abrasive soil, the plumule is protected from damage. Upon exposure to light, the hypocotyl hook straightens out, the
young foliage leaves face the sun and expand, and the epicotyl continues to elongate. During this time, the radicle is also

fruits. As the fruit matures, the seeds also mature.
Fruits may be classified as simple, aggregate, multiple, or accessory, depending on their origin (Figure 32.22). If the fruit
develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, it is known as asimple fruit, as seen in nuts and beans. An
aggregate fruitis one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together
to form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry.Multiple fruitdevelops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers. An
example is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit.Accessory fruits(sometimes called false fruits) are
not derived from the ovary, but from another part of the flower, such as the receptacle (strawberry) or the hypanthium (apples
and pears).
Figure32.22There are four main types of fruits. Simple fruits, such as these nuts, are derived from a single ovary. Aggregate fruits, like
raspberries, form from many carpels that fuse together. Multiple fruits, such as pineapple, form from a cluster of flowers called an
inflorescence. Accessory fruit, like the apple, are formed from a part of the plant other than the ovary. (credit "nuts": modification of work
by Petr Kratochvil; credit "raspberries": modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit "pineapple": modification of work by Howie Le; credit
"apple": modification of work by Paolo Neo)
Fruits generally have three parts: theexocarp(the outermost skin or covering), themesocarp(middle part of the fruit), and the
endocarp(the inner part of the fruit). Together, all three are known as thepericarp. The mesocarp is usually the fleshy, edible
part of the fruit; however, in some fruits, such as the almond, the endocarp is the edible part. In many fruits, two or all three of
the layers are fused, and are indistinguishable at maturity. Fruits can be dry or fleshy. Furthermore, fruits can be divided into
dehiscent or indehiscent types. Dehiscent fruits, such as peas, readily release their seeds, while indehiscent fruits, like peaches,
rely on decay to release their seeds.
Fruit and Seed Dispersal
The fruit has a single purpose: seed dispersal. Seeds contained within fruits need to be dispersed far from the mother plant, so

Asexual Reproduction
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Compare the mechanisms and methods of natural and artificial asexual reproduction
• Describe the advantages and disadvantages of natural and artificial asexual reproduction
• Discuss plant life spans
Many plants are able to propagate themselves using asexual reproduction. This method does not require the investment
required to produce a flower, attract pollinators, or find a means of seed dispersal. Asexual reproduction produces plants that
are genetically identical to the parent plant because no mixing of male and female gametes takes place. Traditionally, these
plants survive well under stable environmental conditions when compared with plants produced from sexual reproduction
because they carry genes identical to those of their parents.
Many different types of roots exhibit asexual reproduction (Figure 32.24). The corm is used by gladiolus and garlic. Bulbs, such
as a scaly bulb in lilies and a tunicate bulb in daffodils, are other common examples. A potato is a stem tuber, while parsnip
propagates from a taproot. Ginger and iris produce rhizomes, while ivy uses an adventitious root (a root arising from a plant
part other than the main or primary root), and the strawberry plant has a stolon, which is also called a runner.

propagate, giving rise to new plants. (c) Ginger forms masses of stems called rhizomes that can give rise to multiple plants. (d) Potato
plants form fleshy stem tubers. Each eye in the stem tuber can give rise to a new plant. (e) Strawberry plants form stolons: stems that grow

Some plants can produce seeds without fertilization. Either the ovule or part of the ovary, which is diploid in nature, gives rise
to a new seed. This method of reproduction is known asapomixis.

Figure32.26Grafting is an artificial method of asexual reproduction used to produce plants combining favorable stem characteristics with
favorable root characteristics. The stem of the plant to be grafted is known as the scion, and the root is called the stock.
Cutting
Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stemcuttings, where a portion of the stem containing nodes and
internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root. In some species, stems can start producing a root even when placed only
in water. For example, leaves of the African violet will root if kept in water undisturbed for several weeks.
Layering
Layeringis a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil. Young stems that can be bent easily
without any injury are preferred. Jasmine and bougainvillea (paper flower) can be propagated this way (Figure 32.27). In some
plants, a modified form of layering known as air layering is employed. A portion of the bark or outermost covering of the stem is
removed and covered with moss, which is then taped. Some gardeners also apply rooting hormone. After some time, roots will
appear, and this portion of the plant can be removed and transplanted into a separate pot.

Plant species that complete their lifecycle in one season are known as annuals, an example of which isArabidopsis, or mouse-ear
cress. Biennials such as carrots complete their lifecycle in two seasons. In a biennial’s first season, the plant has a vegetative
phase, whereas in the next season, it completes its reproductive phase. Commercial growers harvest the carrot roots after the
first year of growth, and do not allow the plants to flower. Perennials, such as the magnolia, complete their lifecycle in two years
or more.
In another classification based on flowering frequency,monocarpicplants flower only once in their lifetime; examples include
bamboo and yucca. During the vegetative period of their life cycle (which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species),
these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once-in-a-
lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization. Soon after flowering, these plants die.Polycarpicplants form flowers
many times during their lifetime. Fruit trees, such as apple and orange trees, are polycarpic; they flower every year. Other
polycarpic species, such as perennials, flower several times during their life span, but not each year. By this means, the plant
does not require all its nutrients to be channelled towards flowering each year.
As is the case with all living organisms, genetics and environmental conditions have a role to play in determining how long a
plant will live. Susceptibility to disease, changing environmental conditions, drought, cold, and competition for nutrients are
some of the factors that determine the survival of a plant. Plants continue to grow, despite the presence of dead tissue such as
cork. Individual parts of plants, such as flowers and leaves, have different rates of survival. In many trees, the older leaves turn
yellow and eventually fall from the tree. Leaf fall is triggered by factors such as a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, due to
shading by upper leaves, or oxidative damage incurred as a result of photosynthetic reactions. The components of the part to be
shed are recycled by the plant for use in other processes, such as development of seed and storage. This process is known as
nutrient recycling.
The aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known assenescence, which is marked by several complex biochemical
changes. One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts, which is characterized by the yellowing of
leaves. The chloroplasts contain components of photosynthetic machinery such as membranes and proteins. Chloroplasts also
contain DNA. The proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are broken down by specific enzymes into smaller molecules and salvaged
by the plant to support the growth of other plant tissues.
The complex pathways of nutrient recycling within a plant are not well understood. Hormones are known to play a role in
senescence. Applications of cytokinins and ethylene delay or prevent senescence; in contrast, abscissic acid causes premature
onset of senescence.

in the deep sea, a rainforest canopy, or the desert. Therefore, a large amount of information about the
structure of an organism's body (anatomy) and the function of its cells, tissues and organs (physiology) can

Most animals have an exoskeleton, including insects, spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, centipedes, and crustaceans.
Scientists estimate that, of insects alone, there are over 30 million species on our planet. The exoskeleton is a hard covering or
shell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land
animals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles.
As the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin
and is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. This is fused to the animal’s epidermis. Ingrowths of the
exoskeleton, calledapodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals (Figure
33.3). In order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the
original covering. This limits the animal’s ability to grow continually, and may limit the individual’s ability to mature if molting
does not occur at the proper time. The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly to accommodate any increase
in weight. It is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of eight. The increasing thickness of the
chitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a relatively small size. The same principles
apply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached on the outside, making it easier to compensate
for increased mass.
Figure33.3Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach. The apodemes on this crab leg are located above
and below the fulcrum of the claw. Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the claw closed.
An animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the other
tissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement. As the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass increase. The
speed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide support and
movement.
Limiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development
The exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. All
living cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. Diffusion is effective over a
specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an

Energy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity
The more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its BMR or SMR. The average
daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal’s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary than most
animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR.
For example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in. The
relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short grasses > forbs (any broad-
leaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals/biennials.
Energy Requirements Related to Environment
Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor.Torporis a process that leads to a decrease in
activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such
as entering a state ofhibernationduring the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body
temperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0° C (32° F), while a bear’s internal
temperature is maintained higher at about 37° C (99° F).
If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is calledestivation. Some desert animals
use this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds.
While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be
endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to conserve energy
during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.
Animal Body Planes and Cavities
A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes. Asagittal planedivides the body into right and left portions. A
midsagittal planedivides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves. Afrontal plane(also called a
coronal plane) separates the front from the back. Atransverse plane(or, horizontal plane) divides the animal into upper and
lower portions. This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane.
Figure 33.5illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged animal) and a human being.
Figure33.5Shown are the planes of a quadrupedal goat and a bipedal human. The midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in half, into
right and left portions. The frontal plane divides the front and back, and the transverse plane divides the body into upper and lower
portions.
Vertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated inFigure 33.6. Two of these are major cavities that
contain smaller cavities within them. Thedorsal cavitycontains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities. Theventral
cavitycontains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity, which

Animal Primary Tissues
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe epithelial tissues
• Discuss the different types of connective tissues in animals
• Describe three types of muscle tissues
• Describe nervous tissue
The tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Recall that
tissues are groups of similar cells (cells carrying out related functions). These tissues combine to form organs—like the skin or
kidney—that have specific, specialized functions within the body. Organs are organized into organ systems to perform
functions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and the digestive system,
consisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. Organ systems come together to create an
entire organism.
Epithelial Tissues
Epithelial tissuescover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or
multiple layers of cells. The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells.
Epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is calledsimple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers is called
stratified epithelia.Table 33.2summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues.
Different Types of Epithelial Tissues

transitional round, simple but appear stratified urinary bladder
Table33.2
Squamous Epithelia
Squamous epithelialcells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus. The cell outline is slightly
irregular, and cells fit together to form a covering or lining. When the cells are arranged in a single layer (simple epithelia), they
facilitate diffusion in tissues, such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and the exchange of nutrients and waste at blood
capillaries.

Figure33.9Simple columnar epithelial cells absorb material from the digestive tract. Goblet cells secrete mucus into the digestive tract
lumen.
Columnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified. However, each cell is attached to the base membrane
of the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells, making it
appear as though there is more than one layer, as seen inFigure 33.10. This is calledpseudostratified, columnar epithelia. This
cellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells. The cilia enhance the movement of mucus and trapped
particles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and harmful material that has
been breathed into the body. Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of the trachea). The goblet cells
contain mucus that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from getting into the lungs.
Figure33.10Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract. They exist in one layer, but the arrangement of nuclei at
different levels makes it appear that there is more than one layer. Goblet cells interspersed between the columnar epithelial cells secrete
mucus into the respiratory tract.
Transitional Epithelia
Transitionalor uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter. These cells are
arranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty
bladder, as illustrated inFigure 33.11. As the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the volume of
urine introduced into it. As the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner. In other words, the tissue transitions

Loose/Areolar Connective Tissue
Loose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue. As
illustrated inFigure 33.12, loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts; macrophages are present as well. Collagen fibers are
relatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black. The space between the formed
elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix. The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a
cotton ball that has been pulled apart. Loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel and helps to keep the vessel in
place. The tissue is also found around and between most body organs. In summary, areolar tissue is tough, yet flexible, and
comprises membranes.
Figure33.12Loose connective tissue is composed of loosely woven collagen and elastic fibers. The fibers and other components of the
connective tissue matrix are secreted by fibroblasts.
Fibrous Connective Tissue
Fibrous connective tissuescontain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material. The fibers can be arranged
irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel. Irregularly arranged fibrous connective tissues are found in areas of
the body where stress occurs from all directions, such as the dermis of the skin. Regular fibrous connective tissue, shown in
Figure 33.13, is found in tendons (which connect muscles to bones) and ligaments (which connect bones to bones).

the tissue hardness. Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in
the matrix, the tissue bends.
There are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth
and remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live,
but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts are active in breaking
down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are usually found on the
surface of the tissue.
Bone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and
the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is organized into
subunits calledosteons, as illustrated inFigure 33.15. A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within
the Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are
microchannels calledcanaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells. Spongy bone is made of tiny plates
calledtrabeculae; these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. Over time, these plates can break causing the
bone to become less resilient. Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals, providing structure to the animal
and points of attachment for tendons.

Figure33.16Adipose is a connective tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes. Adipocytes have small nuclei localized at the cell edge.
Blood
Blood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix, as shown inFigure 33.17. The living cell types are red blood cells
(RBC), also called erythrocytes, and white blood cells (WBC), also called leukocytes. The fluid portion of whole blood, its matrix,
is commonly called plasma.
Figure33.17Blood is a connective tissue that has a fluid matrix, called plasma, and no fibers. Erythrocytes (red blood cells), the
predominant cell type, are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Also present are various leukocytes (white blood cells)
involved in immune response.
The cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the
average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the same size
in a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 µl, a dog is
close at 7.0 µl, but a cat’s RBC diameter is 5.9 µl. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 µl. Mammalian erythrocytes lose
their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish, amphibian, and avian
red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell’s life. The principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry
and deliver oxygen to the tissues.
Leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in the
blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per µl, dogs from 5,600 to
19,200 cells per µl, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per µl, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per µl, and pigs from 11,000 to 22,000
cells per µl.
Lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. Different types of lymphocytes make
antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and
they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered

Nervous Tissues
Nervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body and to
send them to specific locations in the body. The main cell of the nervous system is the neuron, illustrated inFigure 33.19. The
large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron. Projections from the cell body are either dendrites
specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also shown. Astrocytes
regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is
transferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron.
Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. A nerve consists of neurons and glial
cells.
Figure33.19The neuron has projections called dendrites that receive signals and projections called axons that send signals. Also shown
are two types of glial cells: astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the
electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently.

Pathologist
A pathologist is a medical doctor or veterinarian who has specialized in the laboratory detection of disease in animals, including
humans. These professionals complete medical school education and follow it with an extensive post-graduate residency at a
medical center. A pathologist may oversee clinical laboratories for the evaluation of body tissue and blood samples for the
detection of disease or infection. They examine tissue specimens through a microscope to identify cancers and other diseases.
Some pathologists perform autopsies to determine the cause of death and the progression of disease.

As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved. The direction is
maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during
childbirth, as illustrated inFigure 33.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the
uterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside,
more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.

State whether each of the following processes is regulated by a positive feedback loop or a negative feedback loop.
a. A person feels satiated after eating a large meal.
b. The blood has plenty of red blood cells. As a result, erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of new red
blood cells, is no longer released from the kidney.
Set Point
It is possible to adjust a system’s set point. When this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting. An
example of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued
increases in blood pressure. The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to the
lower set point. The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body.
Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level. This is called a process of
alterationof the set point in a feedback loop.
Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system. This is called
acclimatization. This occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than that to which it is accustomed. In
order to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the
blood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal
changes in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in
keeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels.

Feedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car along a track: watch a short video lesson on positive and

Heat Conservation and Dissipation
Animals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways. In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of insulation,
such as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air
between their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a
constant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in
cold weather. Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector pili muscles cause “goose
bumps,” causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect of increasing body temperature.
Mammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual’s
ability to conserve heat.
Endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the
body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow
in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. Some animals
have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood returning to
the heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other
internal organs. This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs. The countercurrent
adaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. In contrast, similar
adaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.
Some ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. For example, a desert ectothermic
animal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. The same
animals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. Some animals seek water to aid evaporation in cooling
them, as seen with reptiles. Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter.
Many animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. When muscles are contracted, most of the
energy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat. Severe cold elicits a shivering reflex that
generates heat for the body. Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in generating heat.

• Explain the processes of digestion and absorption
• Compare and contrast different types of digestive systems
• Explain the specialized functions of the organs involved in processing food in the body
• Describe the ways in which organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients
Animals obtain their nutrition from the consumption of other organisms. Depending on their diet, animals
can be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those
that eat both plants and animals (omnivores). The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not
immediately accessible to the cells. There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body
in order to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function. As animals evolved in
complexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various
dietary needs.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores
Herbivoresare animals whose primary food source is plant-based. Examples of herbivores, as shown in
Figure 34.2include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as
crickets and caterpillars. These animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of
plant material. Herbivores can be further classified into frugivores (fruit-eaters), granivores (seed eaters),
nectivores (nectar feeders), and folivores (leaf eaters).
Figure34.2Herbivores, like this (a) mule deer and (b) monarch caterpillar, eat primarily plant material. (credit a:
modification of work by Bill Ebbesen; credit b: modification of work by Doug Bowman)
Carnivoresare animals that eat other animals. The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means
“meat eater.” Wild cats such as lions, shown inFigure 34.3a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores,
as are snakes and sharks, while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars, spiders, and ladybugs, shown in
Figure 34.3b. Obligate carnivores are those that rely entirely on animal flesh to obtain their nutrients;
examples of obligate carnivores are members of the cat family, such as lions and cheetahs. Facultative
carnivores are those that also eat non-animal food in addition to animal food. Note that there is no clear line
that differentiates facultative carnivores from omnivores; dogs would be considered facultative carnivores.

Omnivoresare animals that eat both plant- and animal-derived food. In Latin, omnivore means to eat everything. Humans,
bears (shown inFigure 34.4a), and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores; invertebrate omnivores include cockroaches
and crayfish (shown inFigure 34.4b).
Figure34.4Omnivores like the (a) bear and (b) crayfish eat both plant and animal based food. (credit a: modification of work by Dave
Menke; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)
Invertebrate Digestive Systems
Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. The
simplest example is that of agastrovascular cavityand is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.
Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of
digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown inFigure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the
“mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells
within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that breakdown the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the
gastrovascular cavity.
Thealimentary canal, shown inFigure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an
anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the
mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is
churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is
eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.

• Digestive Systems 951
Figure34.6(a) Humans and herbivores, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system. However, in the rabbit the small
intestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material. The enlarged organ provides more surface area for absorption
of nutrients. Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it
passes as soft feces called cecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.

Birds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. They do not have teeth and so their digestive
system, shown inFigure 34.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect
the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are
high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers: the
proventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and thegizzard, where the
food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated.
Most of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca.

• Digestive Systems 953
To help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated in
Figure 34.8. The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. These chambers
contain many microbes that breakdown cellulose and ferment ingested food. The abomasum is the “true” stomach and is the
equivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted. The four-compartment gastric chamber
provides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. The fermentation process
produces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. As in other animals, the small intestine plays
an important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.
Figure34.8Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs. The first two stomachs, the rumen and the reticulum, contain
prokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber. The ruminant regurgitates cud from the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it
into a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water. The cud then passes onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested
by enzymes produced by the ruminant.
Pseudo-ruminants
Some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting
plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these
animals cannot breakdown cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system
must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and breakdown the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a three-chamber
stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum—a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing
many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials—is large and is the site where the roughage is
fermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.
Parts of the Digestive System
The vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that
sustain organisms.
Oral Cavity
The oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated inFigure 34.9. The food consumed is
broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food.
The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary
glands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands
that secrete saliva—the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers

stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens,
and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the
stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true sphincter,
but the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action. Acid reflux or “heartburn” occurs when the acidic
digestive juices escape into the esophagus.
Stomach
A large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown inFigure 34.11. Thestomachis a saclike organ that secretes gastric
digestive juices. The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5. This highly acidic environment is required for the chemical
breakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients. When empty, the stomach is a rather small organ; however, it can expand to
up to 20 times its resting size when filled with food. This characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat when
food is available.

# Chapter 625

## Section 625.1
• Digestive Systems 957
d. The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen.
The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The “C-
shaped,” fixed part of the small intestine is called theduodenumand is shown inFigure 34.11. The duodenum is separated from
the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the
duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of
chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver,
and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum.Bileis produced in the liver and
stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes
that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices breakdown the food particles in the chyme into
glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids
also takes place in the duodenum.
The second part of the small intestine is called thejejunum, shown inFigure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued
while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and
nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.
Theileum, also illustrated inFigure 34.11is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed
into the bloodstream. The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. The
ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, “worm-like,” appendix is located at the ileocecal
valve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.
Large Intestine
Thelarge intestine, illustrated inFigure 34.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste
material. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has
three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the
waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestive processes. The colon can be
divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. The main
functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. Carnivorous
mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.
Figure34.13The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated.
Rectum and Anus
Therectumis the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown inFigure 34.13. The primary role of the rectum is to store the
feces until defecation. The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. Theanusis an opening at the
far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control
elimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.
Accessory Organs
The organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. Accessory organs are organs that
add secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas,

• Define the primary components of food
• Describe the essential nutrients required for cellular function that cannot be synthesized by the animal body
• Explain how energy is produced through diet and digestion
• Describe how excess carbohydrates and energy are stored in the body
Given the diversity of animal life on our planet, it is not surprising that the animal diet would also vary substantially. The animal
diet is the source of materials needed for building DNA and other complex molecules needed for growth, maintenance, and
reproduction; collectively these processes are called biosynthesis. The diet is also the source of materials for ATP production in
the cells. The diet must be balanced to provide the minerals and vitamins that are required for cellular function.
Food Requirements
What are the fundamental requirements of the animal diet? The animal diet should be well balanced and provide nutrients
required for bodily function and the minerals and vitamins required for maintaining structure and regulation necessary for
good health and reproductive capability. These requirements for a human are illustrated graphically inFigure 34.14

Organic Precursors
The organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food. Carbohydrates or sugars are the
primary source of organic carbons in the animal body. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down
into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be
broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack
the ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. In humans, these molecules provide the fiber required for moving
waste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition
from these plant fibers. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles for later
use. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food
shortage. Excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower layer of the skin of mammals for insulation and
energy storage. Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in order to survive famine and aid in mobility.
Another important requirement is that of nitrogen. Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen. Amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function. The carbon and
nitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues. Excess
nitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic. Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also
significant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories. Fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of
fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.
Essential Nutrients
While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are some
nutrients that need to be consumed from food. These nutrients are termedessential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten,
and the body cannot produce them.
The omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane
phospholipids.Vitaminsare another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes
to function and, for this reason, are considered to be coenzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on
health, as outlined inTable 34.1andTable 34.2. Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must be obtained from food.
Minerals, listed inTable 34.3, are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. Among their many functions,
minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered cofactors. Certain amino acids also must be procured from food
and cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the “essential” amino acids. The human body can synthesize only
11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food. The essential amino acids are listed inTable 34.4.

Food Energy and ATP
Animals need food to obtain energy and maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable
internal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment. For example, the normal body temperature of
humans is 37°C (98.6°F). Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. It takes energy
to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food.
The primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. Glucose is called the body’s fuel. The digestible
carbohydrates in an animal’s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions.
Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. ATP
releases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group. ATP is

Digestive System Processes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the process of digestion
• Detail the steps involved in digestion and absorption
• Define elimination
• Explain the role of both the small and large intestines in absorption
Obtaining nutrition and energy from food is a multistep process. For true animals, the first step is ingestion, the act of taking in
food. This is followed by digestion, absorption, and elimination. In the following sections, each of these steps will be discussed
in detail.
Ingestion
The large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes. Food needs to be broken into smaller particles
so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules. The first step in this process isingestion. Ingestion is the
process of taking in food through the mouth. In vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in mastication
(preparing the food into bolus). While the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin to chemically
process the food as well. The combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a soft mass that can be
swallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus.

## Section 629.2
• Digestive System Processes 965
Digestion and Absorption
Digestionis the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small organic fragments. It is important to breakdown
macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. Large, complex
molecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before they can be
absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. Different organs play specific roles in the digestive process. The animal diet needs
carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance. How each of these
components is digested is discussed in the following sections.
Carbohydrates
The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into
maltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of
carbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The acidic
environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.
The next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the
duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain
amylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. The disaccharides are broken
down into monosaccharides by enzymes calledmaltases,sucrases, andlactases, which are also present in the brush border of
the small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken
down by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or “table sugar”) into glucose and fructose, and lactase
breaks down lactose (or “milk sugar”) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed
and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal
epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate digestion are
summarized inFigure 34.16andTable 34.5.
Figure34.16Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes. Starch and glycogen are broken down into glucose by amylase
and maltase. Sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar) are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively.

Lipids
Lipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase. However, the bulk of lipid digestion occurs
in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger the release of
bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily triglycerides by
emulsification. Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small lipid globules. These
small globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. Lipids are hydrophobic
substances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water. Bile contains bile salts,
which are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Thus, the bile salts hydrophilic side can
interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. By doing so, bile salts emulsify
large lipid globules into small lipid globules.
Why is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that
breakdown lipids). If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available for the
lipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface area of the
lipids many fold. The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed inFigure 34.18.
Lipases breakdown the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. These molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell
and enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming
tiny spheres called micelles. The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where the long-chain
fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the micelles behind in the chyme. The
long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules
and become coated with proteins. These large spheres are calledchylomicrons. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol,
and other lipids and have proteins on their surface. The surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate "heads" of
phospholipids. Together, they enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water.
Chylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis. Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the
subclavian vein.

b. Trypsin and lipase in the stomach digest protein.
c. Bile emulsifies lipids in the small intestine.
d. No food is absorbed until the small intestine.
Elimination
The final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products. The undigested food material
enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called “intestinal
flora” that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle
and is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required
to set up the urge to eliminate. The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum.
Common Problems with Elimination
Diarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion. Constipation is a condition
where the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon. In contrast, if enough water is not removed from the
feces, it results in diarrhea. Many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water
reabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea.

Digestive System Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the role of neural regulation in digestive processes
• Explain how hormones regulate digestion
The brain is the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety. The functions of the digestive system are regulated
through neural and hormonal responses.
Neural Responses to Food
In reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown inFigure 34.20, the first response is that of salivation. The
salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by food in preparation
for digestion. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. Recall that the peristaltic
movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. The brain prepares these
muscles for movement as well. When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness. There are
three overlapping phases of gastric control—the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase—each requires many
enzymes and is under neural control as well.
Figure34.20Seeing a plate of food triggers the secretion of saliva in the mouth and the production of HCL in the stomach. (credit: Kelly
Bailey)
Digestive Phases
The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. The first phase of ingestion, called thecephalic phase, is
controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects—such as sight, sense, and smell—trigger the
neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase
can also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the
increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive
food.
Thegastric phasebegins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase.
Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a
decrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. This phase consists of local, hormonal,
and neural responses. These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.

## Section 632.2
• Digestive System Regulation 971
Theintestinal phasebegins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions. This phase controls the rate
of gastric emptying. In addition to gastrin emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal and
neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.
Hormonal Responses to Food
Theendocrinesystemcontrols the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate
times.
One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. During the gastric phase, the hormone
gastrinis secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach
acid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins. However, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic
environment need not be maintained and a hormone calledsomatostatinstops the release of hydrochloric acid. This is
controlled by a negative feedback mechanism.
In the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme
during the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone calledsecretinstimulates the pancreas to
produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called
cholecystokinin(CCK). Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also stimulates
the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.

Visitthis website(http://openstax.org/l/enteric_endo)to learn more about the endocrine system. Review the text and watch the
animation of how control is implemented in the endocrine system.
Another level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food. Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest.
A hormone calledgastric inhibitory peptideis secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the
intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed.
Understanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research. Scientists are exploring
the role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones. Advances could lead to
knowledge that may help to battle the obesity epidemic.

The nervous system is made up ofneurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and
glia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to
neurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire—it transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared
to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that
are broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that they also usurp some of the signaling
functions of neurons.
There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system. There are four
major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.
Neurons
The nervous system of the common laboratory fly,Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same
number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains
around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same
behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to
communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.
Most neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized—different types of neurons have
different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.
Parts of a Neuron
Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi
apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated inFigure 35.3for
receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible.Dendritesare tree-like structures that
extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions calledsynapses. Although some
neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small protrusions called
dendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.
Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized structure,
theaxon hillockthat integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and anaxon. An
axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings calledaxon terminals. These terminals
in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be
communicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina,
do not contain any axons. Some axons are covered withmyelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the
electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed of conduction. This insulation is important as the axon
from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter—from the base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is not actually
part of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are
callednodes of Ranvierand are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along the axon.
It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone—neuronal communication depends on the connections that
neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive
synaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive
contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.

Figure35.4There is great diversity in the size and shape of neurons throughout the nervous system. Examples include (a) a pyramidal cell
from the cerebral cortex, (b) a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar cortex, and (c) olfactory cells from the olfactory epithelium and olfactory
bulb.
While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar,
multipolar, and pseudounipolar.Figure 35.5illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one structure
that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate
muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is
a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to
ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar
neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and
spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but
only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single
process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a
bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to
dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord.

laboratory simulation and a video that explains how BrdU labels new cells.
Glia
While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually
outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are
fulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise
harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in
responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells. When glia do not function properly, the result
can be disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.
Types of Glia
There are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown inFigure 35.7.Astrocytes, shown in
Figure 35.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances to
neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for
synapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier—a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain.
Astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity,
transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses.Satellite gliaprovide nutrients

All functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory
or a decision—require neurons to communicate with one another. While humans use words and body language to
communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and
synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send the message on to other neurons.

Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron
For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each
neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this
membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To
understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge.
Neuronal Charged Membranes
The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron,
ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different
configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated inFigure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open
and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape
accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels.
Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in
total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called themembrane potential.
Figure35.9Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage. After activation, they become inactivated for a
brief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.
LINK TO LEARNING
This video discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.
Click to view content(https://www.openstax.org/l/resting_neuron)
Resting Membrane Potential
A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (−70 mV,
note that this number varies by neuron type and by species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by
differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each
type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the
membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown inTable 35.1. The
difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane
potential (Figure 35.10). When the membrane is at rest, K+ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the
concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of
cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell
is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons,
potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations
outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their
concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels.
Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell
than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the
sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings

A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.

LINK TO LEARNING
Thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/actionpotential)presents an overview of action potential.
Myelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential
For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon
terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is
influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents
current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple
sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier,
illustrated inFigure 35.13are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer
long and contain voltage-gated Na+and K+channels. Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na+channels,
regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. This ‘jumping’ of the action potential from one node to the
next is calledsaltatory conduction. If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action potential would propagate
very slowly since Na+and K+channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon
instead of at specific points. Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the
nodes and not along the entire axon.
Figure35.13Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons. Nodes contain voltage-gated K+and Na+channels. Action
potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.

Figure35.15Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic membrane is depolarized,
voltage-gated Ca2+channels open and allow Ca2+to enter the cell. The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane
and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-
gated ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.
The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the
postsynaptic membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic
membrane, as detailed inTable 35.1. For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle
(called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na+channels to open. Na+enters the
postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called anexcitatory postsynaptic

depolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these inputs are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are
strong enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron will fire.
Everyday Connection
Brain-computer interface
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig’s Disease) is a neurological disease characterized by the
degeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary movements. The disease begins with muscle weakening and lack
of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease
can lead to paralysis. At that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate.
Several special technologies have been developed to allow “locked-in” patients to communicate with the rest of the world.
One technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences can then be
read aloud by a computer.
A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate and retain a
degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated inFigure 35.17. This
technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their
thoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These
recordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI
require the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor
cortex. This form of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one
or more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a
tool—such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can use e-mail, read the Internet, and
communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm (even though the paralyzed patient cannot make
that bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to
control a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using BCI technology.
Despite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations. The technology can require many hours of
training and long periods of intense concentration for the patient; it can also require brain surgery to implant the devices.

• The Central Nervous System 995
Long-term Depression (LTD)
Long-term depression (LTD)is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection. One
mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors
initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as
illustrated inFigure 35.18. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to
glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning
and memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes
the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.
Figure35.18Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term
potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated. This stimulation causes a
calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.
The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus
depolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low
firing rate of the presynaptic neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein
phosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the postsynaptic neuron less
responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.

Figure35.20These illustrations show the (a) coronal and (b) sagittal sections of the human brain.
In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a
condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an object is
presented to patients’ left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object
at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to
the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a
specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally
identify it.

Seethis website(http://openstax.org/l/split-brain)to learn more about split-brain patients and to play a game where you can

Each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. Scientists use various techniques
to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or diseases that
affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits. They also conduct animal studies where they
stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes. They use a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head; and they use
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that
correlate with specific behavioral tasks. These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the functions of different
brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process, and any
given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. That being said, each hemisphere of the
mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal,
and occipital.Figure 35.21illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.

area is correlated with complex behavior.
Basal Ganglia
Interconnected brain areas called thebasal ganglia(orbasal nuclei), shown inFigure 35.20b, play important roles in movement
control and posture. Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson’s disease, leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait
when walking. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation. For example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral basal ganglia damage
in a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything or anybody. But when he
was externally stimulated—as when someone asked to play a card game with him—he was able to function normally.
Interestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state.
Thalamus
Thethalamus(Greek for “inner chamber”), illustrated inFigure 35.24, acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives
sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate
conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus
helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. A rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the
degeneration of thalamic neurons and glia. This disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other
symptoms, and is eventually fatal.

body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks
like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated inFigure 35.25. Myelinated axons make up the “white matter”
and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the “gray matter.” Gray matter is also composed of interneurons, which connect two
neurons each located in different parts of the body. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal (facing the back of the animal) spinal cord
convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the
animal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.
The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a
hand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a
doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a
reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit
information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).
In the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. Because the spinal cord is the information
superhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. The extent of the paralysis
depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed. For example, if
the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas damage to the spinal
column further down may limit paralysis to the legs. Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves
do not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect
severed nerves. Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury. One
such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia. This cooling can prevent swelling and other
processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the organization and functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. The CNS is
like the power plant of the nervous system. It creates the signals that control the functions of the body. The PNS is like the wires
that go to individual houses. Without those “wires,” the signals produced by the CNS could not control the body (and the CNS
would not be able to receive sensory information from the body either).
The PNS can be broken down into theautonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions without conscious control,
and thesensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to
the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.

smooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without
conscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed.
Signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a
neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated inFigure 35.26. There are two divisions of the
autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous
system.
Sympathetic Nervous System
Thesympathetic nervous systemis responsible for the “fight or flight” response that occurs when an animal encounters a
dangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake (“snake”
and “sympathetic” both begin with “s”). Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an
accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions help prepare an organism’s body for the physical strain required
to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator.

Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord, as illustrated inFigure 35.27. The
axons of these neurons releaseacetylcholineon postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia (the sympathetic ganglia
form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord). The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons. Postganglionic

Figure35.28The human brain contains 12 cranial nerves that receive sensory input and control motor output for the head and neck.
Spinal nervestransmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Each of the 31 spinal
nerves (in humans) contains both sensory and motor axons. The sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures called
dorsal root ganglia and are shown inFigure 35.29. Each sensory neuron has one projection—with a sensory receptor ending in
skin, muscle, or sensory organs—and another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord. Motor neurons have cell
bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root. These neurons are usually
stimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons.
Figure35.29Spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor axons. The somas of sensory neurons are located in dorsal root ganglia. The
somas of motor neurons are found in the ventral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord.

Parkinson’s Disease
Like Alzheimer’s disease,Parkinson’s diseaseis a neurodegenerative disease. It was first characterized by James Parkinson in
1817. Each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease. Parkinson’s disease causes the loss of
dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement. Loss of these neurons causes many
symptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance and posture problems,
and rigid muscles. The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk, illustrated in
Figure 35.31. Patients with Parkinson’s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such as dementia or emotional
problems.
Although some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact causes
of Parkinson’s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors
(similar to Alzheimer’s disease). Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson’s patients shows the presence of Lewy
bodies—abnormal protein clumps—in dopaminergic neurons. The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates with the
severity of the disease.
There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. One of the most commonly prescribed
drugs for Parkinson’s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain. This conversion
increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra. Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.

that their brains just process information differently.
Except for some well-characterized, clearly genetic forms of autism (like Fragile X and Rett’s Syndrome), the causes of ASD are
largely unknown. Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD, but for any given patient, many different
mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop. At a general level, ASD is thought to be a disease of
“incorrect” wiring. Accordingly, brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected
people. In the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children. This paper was retracted when it
was discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism.
Treatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other disorders
common to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder). Although early interventions can help
mitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for ASD.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected byattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Like
ASD, ADHD is more prevalent in males than females. Symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack of focus), executive
functioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage. Some
patients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD: attention deficit
disorder (ADD). Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity, in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD.
Examples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Figure 35.32provides some statistics concerning
comorbidity with ADHD.
The cause of ADHD is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex
and disturbances in neurotransmission. According to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component. There are
several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered. Environmental factors,
including exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some patients. Treatment for
ADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which paradoxically cause a calming
effect in these patients.

CAREER CONNECTION
Neurologist
Neurologists are physicians who specialize in disorders of the nervous system. They diagnose and treat disorders such as
epilepsy, stroke, dementia, nervous system injuries, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Neurologists
are medical doctors who have attended college, medical school, and completed three to four years of neurology residency.
When examining a new patient, a neurologist takes a full medical history and performs a complete physical exam. The physical
exam contains specific tasks that are used to determine what areas of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system may
be damaged. For example, to check whether the hypoglossal nerve is functioning correctly, the neurologist will ask the patient to
move his or her tongue in different ways. If the patient does not have full control over tongue movements, then the hypoglossal

neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin into the
presynaptic neuron. This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Other types of drugs such as
norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat
depression.
Other Neurological Disorders
There are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories. These include chronic pain
conditions, cancers of the nervous system, epilepsy disorders, and stroke. Epilepsy and stroke are discussed below.
Epilepsy
Estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed withepilepsyin their lifetime. While
there are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy itself can be a symptom of a
brain injury, disease, or other illness. For example, people who have intellectual disability or ASD can experience seizures,
presumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy. For
many patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very severe cases,
patients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.
Stroke
A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without the oxygen
supplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms—depending
on the brain area affected— including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems,
memory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel.
Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States. On average one person
experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65.
Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke. Smoking doubles
the risk of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the
emergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not work if the
stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital.
Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense)
physical therapy.

Figure36.2(a) Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane. A
mechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair-like tethers. When pressure causes the
extracellular matrix to move, the channel opens, allowing ions to enter or exit the cell. (b) Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to
mechanosensitive ion channels. When a sound causes the stereocilia to move, mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the
cochlear nerve.
Sensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of
stimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity. For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each
activated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure.
However, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste.
Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information
Four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the
receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted over a
sensory receptor’s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory
circuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of
the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus—a sound.
The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an intense
stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production
of action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An intense stimulus
might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer
receptors. Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and the brain will
further process incoming signals.

Somatosensation is a mixed sensory category and includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well
from as the limbs and joints. Somatosensation is also known as tactile sense, or more familiarly, as the sense of touch.
Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well. A variety of receptor
types—embedded in the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, joints, internal organs, and cardiovascular system—play a role.

Figure36.5Four of the primary mechanoreceptors in human skin are shown. Merkel’s disks, which are unencapsulated, respond to light
touch. Meissner’s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, and Krause end bulbs are all encapsulated. Meissner’s corpuscles
respond to touch and low-frequency vibration. Ruffini endings detect stretch, deformation within joints, and warmth. Pacinian corpuscles
detect transient pressure and high-frequency vibration. Krause end bulbs detect cold.
Which of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is false?
a. Pacinian corpuscles are found in both glabrous and hairy skin.
b. Merkel’s disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips.
c. Ruffini endings are encapsulated mechanoreceptors.
d. Meissner’s corpuscles extend into the lower dermis.
Meissner’s corpuscles, (shown inFigure 36.6) also known as tactile corpuscles, are found in the upper dermis, but they project
into the epidermis. They, too, are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids. They respond to fine touch
and pressure, but they also respond to low-frequency vibration or flutter. They are rapidly adapting, fluid-filled, encapsulated
neurons with small, well-defined borders and are responsive to fine details. Like Merkel’s disks, Meissner’s corpuscles are not as
plentiful in the palms as they are in the fingertips.
Figure36.6Meissner corpuscles in the fingertips, such as the one viewed here using bright field light microscopy, allow for touch
discrimination of fine detail. (credit: modification of work by "Wbensmith"/Wikimedia Commons; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Deeper in the epidermis, near the base, areRuffini endings, which are also known as bulbous corpuscles. They are found in both
glabrous and hairy skin. These are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch and deformations
within joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and movement. Thus, they
also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia. Ruffini endings also detect warmth. Note that these warmth detectors are
situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors. It is not surprising, then, that humans detect cold stimuli before they
detect warm stimuli.

skin covered with any type of hair, such as the arms, legs, torso, and face. Touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin (the type
found on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin (4 to 5 mm
versus 2 to 3 mm).
How is receptor density estimated in a human subject? The relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on the
body can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test. In this demonstration, two sharp points, such
as two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subject’s skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the skin).
The subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points. If the two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred that the two
points are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor. If two points are felt as two separate points, each is in the
receptive field of two separate sensory receptors. The points could then be moved closer and retested until the subject reports
feeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from that distance.
Thermoreception
In addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold
receptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus, that
are activated by different temperatures. Their pathways into the brain run from the spinal cord through the thalamus to the
primary somatosensory cortex. Warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves to the
brain. You know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense stimulus that
is no longer tolerable. Any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations are conducted
along the same pathways that carry pain sensations.
Pain
Pain is the name given tonociception, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage. Pain is
caused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive
chemical. But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with
capsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain topical
medications. Peppers taste “hot” because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels that are
activated by warm receptors.
Nociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, inasmuch as it is the perception of nociception, does not start until it is
communicated to the brain. There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain. Most axons carrying nociceptive
information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and the neural signal
undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, one nociceptive pathway projects not to the
thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions
of the autonomic nervous system. Recall that threatening—or painful—stimuli stimulate the sympathetic branch of the visceral
sensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response.

• Explain in what way smell and taste stimuli differ from other sensory stimuli
• Identify the five primary tastes that can be distinguished by humans
• Explain in anatomical terms why a dog’s sense of smell is more acute than a human’s
Taste, also calledgustation, and smell, also calledolfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules
of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors. Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other
animals—whether potential mates, predators, or prey—or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival.
Similarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. While the value of a sense of smell is obvious,
what is the value of a sense of taste? Different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful and harmful. For example,
sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in lean times. Bitterness is associated

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Pheromones
Apheromoneis a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species.
Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them, but pheromones apparently are not consciously
perceived in the same way as other odors. There are several different types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as
glandular secretions. Certain pheromones are attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors of
the same sex, and still others play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also influence the timing of
puberty, modify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. While the roles of pheromones in many
nonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over evolutionary time
compared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.
The vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson’s organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many vertebrate animals
that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected to the nasal cavity by a duct. When
molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them
bind with specialized pheromone receptors. Upon exposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals,
including cats, may display the flehmen response (shown inFigure 36.9), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone
molecules enter the VNO.
Pheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects directly to the
amygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such as fear). The pheromonal signal then
continues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive physiology and behavior. While some scientists assert that
the VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in humans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal
cavities, others are researching it as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of
menstrual cycles in women living in close proximity.

Figure36.11Pores in the tongue allow tastants to enter taste pores in the tongue. (credit: modification of work by Vincenzo Rizzo)
In humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. Thus, like olfaction, each
receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect
the molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that enter the taste
neurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. Binding of an acid or
other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H+) concentrations in the
taste neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor. These tastants
bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.
Both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue to
decline. A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and unappetizing.

Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons. Theolfactory bulbis
composed of neural clusters calledglomeruli, and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor, so each
glomerulus is specific to one odorant. From glomeruli, olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the
frontal cortex and the thalamus. Recall that this is a different path from most other sensory information, which is sent directly

Hearing and Vestibular Sensation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the relationship of amplitude and frequency of a sound wave to attributes of sound
• Trace the path of sound through the auditory system to the site of transduction of sound
• Identify the structures of the vestibular system that respond to gravity
Audition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions. It enables an organism to
detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like
those concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular
system is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animal’s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular
acceleration and deceleration, and balance.
Sound
Auditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water.
There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The speed of sound waves differs, based
on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20º C (68º F), sound waves travel in the air at about
343 meters per second.
As is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude.
Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. High-frequency (≥15.000Hz) sounds are
higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; ≤100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in cycles per
second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can perceive sounds with
frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone’s ability to hear
high frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins
150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those frequencies above the human range are
calledultrasound.
Amplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated inFigure 36.12. The
sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. For sound, volume is measured in decibels
(dB). The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.

Reception of Sound
In mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called thepinna, then travel through the
auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called thetympanumor ear drum, the innermost part of theouter ear
(illustrated inFigure 36.13). Interior to the tympanum is themiddle ear. The middle ear holds three small bones called the
ossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are themalleus(also known as
the hammer), theincus(the anvil), andstapes(the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. The three
ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of
the tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the
tympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear.
These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the
bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals
(frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.
Figure36.13Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic membrane. The
middle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window, the exterior boundary of the inner ear. The
organ of Corti, which is the organ of sound transduction, lies inside the cochlea.
Transduction of Sound
Vibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air. When these pressure waves reach the ear,
the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain perceives as
sound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum
transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the
oval window, which is the outermost structure of theinner ear. The structures of the inner ear are found in thelabyrinth, a
bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the
stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves
in the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. Thecochleais a whorled structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors
for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated inFigure 36.14). Inside the cochlea, thebasilar
membraneis a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochlea’s center.
The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at the
outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the whorl
(where the cochlea is smallest). Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave

of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel (refer to
Figure 36.15). As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve. Intensity
(volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.
Figure36.15The hair cell is a mechanoreceptor with an array of stereocilia emerging from its apical surface. The stereocilia are tethered
together by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest member of their array, and closed when the array is
bent toward the shortest member of their array.
The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions,
according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a
specific frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of
greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. The difference in response frequency between adjacent
inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent different. Place theory,
which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency sounds
selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). Lower frequencies travel
farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. The basic pitch-determining mechanism is
based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. The place theory is the first step toward an
understanding of pitch perception. Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be
some auditory “sharpening” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.
When sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach to
the tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along the
neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs bend, they
release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central
nervous system. The cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. The auditory system
is very refined, and there is some modulation or “sharpening” built in. The brain can send signals back to the cochlea, resulting
in a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells’ response to certain frequencies.

Higher Processing
The inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. About 90 percent of the afferent
neurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons. Outer hair cells connect to
only 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. The afferent, bipolar neurons that
convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, finally
reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.

Visionis the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images. Animals are
bombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. Fortunately, the visual
systems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli. The importance of vision to humans is further
substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual
information.
Light
As with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium—a gas, a
liquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum
(Figure 36.17). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the
fundamental unit of light—a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum
shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as
light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light.
Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency)
manifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light
at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one
nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. Some
other animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order
to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off).
Figure36.17In the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light lies between 380 nm and 740 nm. (credit: modification of work by NASA)
Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness. The standard unit of intensity of light is thecandela, which is
approximately the luminous intensity of one common candle.
Light waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and those
waves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves. What is termed “white light” is light that is
perceived as white by the human eye. This effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in the human
eye. The apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects. Thus a red object reflects the red wavelengths

Thefoveais the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has a high density of cones.
When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the object’s image falls on the
fovea. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better viewed by the
peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low
light. In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea.
LINK TO LEARNING
Review theanatomical structure(http://openstax.org/l/eye_diagram)of the eye, clicking on each part to practice identification.
Transduction of Light
The rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal. Both rods and cones contain photopigments. In
vertebrates, the main photopigment,rhodopsin, has two main parts (Figure 36.20): an opsin, which is a membrane protein (in
the form of a cluster of α-helices that span the membrane), and retinal—a molecule that absorbs light. When light hits a
photoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear
(trans) isomer. This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of
Na+channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor. Thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized by
exposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold (Figure 36.21).

# Chapter 672

## Section 672.1
• Vision 1039
Figure36.21When light strikes rhodopsin, the G-protein transducin is activated, which in turn activates phosphodiesterase.
Phosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP, thereby closing sodium channels. As a result, the membrane becomes hyperpolarized. The
hyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell.
Trichromatic Coding
There are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most responsive,
as shown inFigure 36.22. Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are called S cones (“S” for
“short”); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M cones, for “medium”); a third group responds maximally to light of
longer wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or “long” cones). With only one type of cone, color vision would not be possible, and a two-
cone (dichromatic) system has limitations. Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic) system, resulting in full color vision.
The color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. The colors of the visual spectrum, running
from long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue (470 nm), indigo
(450 nm), and violet (425 nm). Humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about 500 levels of
brightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.

seconds, and then quickly look at a white background, noticing how colors appear.
Higher Processing
The myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities of
the visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form, movement,
depth, and differences in brightness. Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on
color and fine detail. Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the
opposite side of the brain. This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek, for “crossing”) found
at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.
Once in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of
visual information to humans and other animals. One route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing
station for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions
remain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. When visual signals leave the thalamus, they
travel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions. One
stream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (“where”) information. A second stream
projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (“where”) and parvocellular (“what”) information.
Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to thesuperior colliculusin the midbrain, where eye movements
are coordinated and integrated with auditory information. Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to thesuprachiasmatic
nucleus(SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body’s internal clock, which controls
ourcircadian(day-long) cycle. The SCN sends information to the pineal gland, which is important in sleep/wake patterns and
annual cycles.

Types of Hormones
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the different types of hormones
• Explain their role in maintaining homeostasis
Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs.
Communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body,
occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids (usually
blood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells. At the target cells, which are cells that have a receptor
for a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response. The cells, tissues, and organs that
secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of glands of the endocrine system include the
adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses
to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.
Although there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be divided into three classes based
on their chemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins)
hormones. One of the key distinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across
plasma membranes whereas the amino acid-derived and peptide hormones cannot.

Figure37.3(a) The hormone epinephrine, which triggers the fight-or-flight response, is derived from the amino acid tyrosine. (b) The
hormone melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms, is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.
Peptide Hormones
The structure ofpeptide hormonesis that of a polypeptide chain (chain of amino acids). The peptide hormones include
molecules that are short polypeptide chains, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into
the blood in the posterior pituitary gland. This class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by the
pituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary.Figure 37.4illustrates these
peptide hormones.
Secreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them. They are then released in response to
stimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin. Amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water-soluble
and insoluble in lipids. These hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors are found on
the surface of the target cells.
Figure37.4The structures of peptide hormones (a) oxytocin, (b) growth hormone, and (c) follicle-stimulating hormone are shown. These
peptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids.

## Section 683.1
How Hormones Work
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how hormones work
• Discuss the role of different types of hormone receptors
Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specifichormonereceptors. In this way, even though hormones
circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the
necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number
of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity
throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of
hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone, and the
resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in
increased or decreased cell sensitivity. Inup-regulation, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels,
making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity. When the number of receptors decreases
in response to rising hormone levels, calleddown-regulation, cellular activity is reduced.
Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes. Depending on the
location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes
directly by binding tointracellular hormone receptorsand modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell
surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways.
Intracellular Hormone Receptors
Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell. Once outside
the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. At the target cell, the hormones are released
from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells. The steroid hormones pass through
the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The cell
signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's DNA. The hormones and receptor

• How Hormones Work 1053
complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA molecules of specific genes. This, in
turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression. This protein can be used
either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. In this way, the steroid
hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated inFigure 37.5.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure37.5An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein (HSP). Upon hormone binding,
the receptor dissociates from the heat shock protein and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the hormone-receptor complex binds
to a DNA sequence called a hormone response element (HRE), which triggers gene transcription and translation. The corresponding protein
product can then mediate changes in cell function.
Heat shock proteins (HSP) are so named because they help refold misfolded proteins. In response to increased temperature (a
“heat shock”), heat shock proteins are activated by release from the NR/HSP complex. At the same time, transcription of HSP
genes is activated. Why do you think the cell responds to a heat shock by increasing the activity of proteins that help refold
misfolded proteins?
Other lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, have receptors located in the
nucleus. While thyroxine is mostly hydrophobic, its passage across the membrane is dependent on transporter protein. Vitamin
D diffuses across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. Once in the cell, both hormones bind to receptors in the
nucleus. The hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes.
Plasma Membrane Hormone Receptors
Amino acid-derived hormones (with the exception of thyroxine) and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble)
and therefore cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer
surface of the plasma membrane, viaplasma membrane hormone receptors. Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble
hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA. Binding of these
hormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out
the specific effects associated with the hormone. In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that
binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell. The hormone that
initiates the signaling pathway is called afirst messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in
Figure 37.6.

• Regulation of Body Processes 1055
Hormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. The key regulatory processes that will be
examined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations,
growth, and the stress response.
Hormonal Regulation of the Excretory System
Maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia). The water
concentration of the body is monitored byosmoreceptorsin the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of electrolytes in
the extracellular fluid. The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive
perspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. An increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a
neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two components: anterior
and posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones. The posterior pituitary is an
extension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known asantidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is transported to and
released from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the
kidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and
wastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH
secretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress can
cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained, causing an
increase in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes the kidneys to
become more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels, aquaporins, into the kidney tubules. Water moves
out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is reabsorbed into the capillaries lowering
blood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor
activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can be reduced by certain substances, including
alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.
Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results indiabetes insipidus. If the posterior pituitary
does not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but
water taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur, but
severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.
Another hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids isaldosterone, a steroid
hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain
proper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+reabsorption and K+secretion from
extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the
concentrations of minerals Na+and K+, aldosterone is referred to as amineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects ion and
water balance. Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood pressure, or an
increase in blood potassium levels. It also prevents the loss of Na+from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice. The reabsorption of Na+
also results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure.
Aldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as illustrated in
Figure 37.7. When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. Cells in the
juxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and releaserenin. Renin, an
enzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen. When
angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs.
Angiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, resulting
in increased Na+reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II in addition to being a potent
vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood pressure.

Figure37.8Professional baseball player Jason Giambi publically admitted to, and apologized for, his use of anabolic steroids supplied
by a trainer. (credit: Bryce Edwards)
Some athletes attempt to boost their performance by using artificial hormones that enhance muscle performance. Anabolic
steroids, a form of the male sex hormone testosterone, are one of the most widely known performance-enhancing drugs.
Steroids are used to help build muscle mass. Other hormones that are used to enhance athletic performance include
erythropoietin, which triggers the production of red blood cells, and human growth hormone, which can help in building
muscle mass. Most performance enhancing drugs are illegal for nonmedical purposes. They are also banned by national and
international governing bodies including the International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, the Major League Baseball, and the National Football League.
The side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and nonreversible, and in some cases, fatal. Androgens produce
several complications such as liver dysfunctions and liver tumors, prostate gland enlargement, difficulty urinating,
premature closure of epiphyseal cartilages, testicular atrophy, infertility, and immune system depression. The physiological
strain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle, leading to unpredictable and dangerous
effects and linking their use to heart attacks, strokes, and impaired cardiac function.
Regulation of the Female Reproductive System
In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells produce
the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and
stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated inFigure 37.9. Estradiol and progesterone are
steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both
estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.

Additional regulation is mediated by the thyroid hormones.
Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon
Cells of the body require nutrients in order to function, and these nutrients are obtained through feeding. In order to manage
nutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores.
Insulinis produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise (for
example, after a meal is consumed). Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization
by target cells, which use glucose for ATP production. It also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen, which is then
stored by cells for later use. Insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and the liver. This
results from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes, which remove
glucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion. As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and signal transduction,
it triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane. This allows glucose to enter the cell, where it can
be used as an energy source. However, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those in the kidneys and brain, can
access glucose without the use of insulin. Insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to fat in adipocytes and the synthesis
of proteins. These actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall, called a hypoglycemic “low sugar”
effect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback loop.

Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition calleddiabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated inFigure
37.10. This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced sensitivity of tissue
cells to insulin. This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood glucose, orhyperglycemia(high
sugar). High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine, resulting in
glucose being lost in urine. High glucose levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts
of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. Over time, high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes
and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system. Oversecretion of insulin can cause
hypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels. This causes insufficient glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness,
and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated.

When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels, for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during
exercise, the hormoneglucagonis released from the alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon raises blood glucose levels, eliciting
what is called a hyperglycemic effect, by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells
in a process calledglycogenolysis. Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the
liver cells. Glucagon also stimulates absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver, which then converts them to glucose.
This process of glucose synthesis is calledgluconeogenesis. Glucagon also stimulates adipose cells to release fatty acids into the

The follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize T and T . Iodides obtained from the
3 4
diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher than in blood.
The typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table salt. Inadequate
iodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T and T hormones. The thyroid
3 4
gland enlarges in a condition calledgoiter, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid
hormone. Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid
accumulation in the thyroid. In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid begins to accumulate
more and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.
Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones.Hypothyroidism,
underproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and
reduced mental activity, among other symptoms. In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to mental
retardation and growth defects.Hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased metabolic
rate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate. Graves’ disease is one example of
a hyperthyroid condition.
Hormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels
Regulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which are
electrically stimulated. If calcium levels get too high, membrane permeability to sodium decreases and membranes become less
responsive. If calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or muscle spasms can
result.
Blood calcium levels are regulated byparathyroid hormone (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as illustrated in
Figure 37.12. PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2+levels. PTH increases Ca2+levels by targeting the skeleton, the
kidneys, and the intestine. In the skeleton, PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed, releasing Ca2+from
bone into the blood. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing Ca2+deposition in bone. In the intestines, PTH increases dietary
Ca2+absorption, and in the kidneys, PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2+. While PTH acts directly on the kidneys to
increase Ca2+reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect. PTH triggers the formation of calcitriol, an active form of
vitamin D, which acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium. PTH release is inhibited by rising blood
calcium levels.

from the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells, and other target
cells, as shown inFigure 37.13. This is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid concentration levels are
high in the blood. GH levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus. GH release is stimulated bygrowth
hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)and is inhibited bygrowth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also called
somatostatin.
Figure37.13Growth hormone directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones. Insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and also allows formation of new proteins in muscle cells and bone. (credit: modification of work by

A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development. Underproduction of GH in adults does not appear
to cause any abnormalities, but in children it can result inpituitary dwarfism, in which growth is reduced. Pituitary dwarfism is
characterized by symmetric body formation. In some cases, individuals are under 30 inches in height. Oversecretion of growth
hormone can lead togigantismin children, causing excessive growth. In some documented cases, individuals can reach heights
of over eight feet. In adults, excessive GH can lead toacromegaly, a condition in which there is enlargement of bones in the face,
hands, and feet that are still capable of growth.

Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the
reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume.
Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known asCushing’s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage
areas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood.
Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can causeAddison’s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and
low electrolyte levels in the blood.

Regulation of Hormone Production
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how hormone production is regulated
• Discuss the different stimuli that control hormone levels in the body
Hormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback. In negative feedback systems, a stimulus elicits
the release of a substance; once the substance reaches a certain level, it sends a signal that stops further release of the substance.
In this way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range. For example, the anterior pituitary
signals the thyroid to release thyroid hormones. Increasing levels of these hormones in the blood then give feedback to the
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland, as illustrated inFigure 37.14. There are
three mechanisms by which endocrine glands are stimulated to synthesize and release hormones: humoral stimuli, hormonal
stimuli, and neural stimuli.

Endocrine Glands
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the role of different glands in the endocrine system
• Explain how the different glands work together to maintain homeostasis
Both the endocrine and nervous systems use chemical signals to communicate and regulate the body's physiology. The
endocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development, growth, energy metabolism,
reproduction, and many behaviors. The nervous system releases neurotransmitters or neurohormones that regulate neurons,
muscle cells, and endocrine cells. Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones, the nervous and endocrine systems
work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body's physiology.
Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis
Thehypothalamusin vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ
located in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses
to environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along
axons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the
anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via
neuronal control.
Thepituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or “master gland” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a
groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated inFigure 37.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the
pituitary stalk(or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting
hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release
hormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions—the anterior pituitary and the posterior
pituitary—which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland
contains axons of the hypothalamic neurons.

Anterior Pituitary
Theanterior pituitarygland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus,
down along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. This capillary network is a part of thehypophyseal portal system
that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the
circulatory system. A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore, the hypophyseal portal
system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the
circulatory system.
The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and
luteinizing hormone (LH). Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they control the
functioning of other organs. While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by
regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting
hormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. These travel from the hypothalamus through
the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect. Negative feedback then regulates how
much of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is secreted.
Posterior Pituitary
Theposterior pituitaryis significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. It is a part of the brain, extending down
from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from the
hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the
neurohypophysis.
The hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the
hypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. They are released into the
circulatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus. These hormones are considered to be posterior pituitary
hormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the circulatory
system. The posterior pituitary itself does not produce hormones, but instead stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus
and releases them into the bloodstream.
Thyroid Gland
Thethyroid glandis located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown inFigure 37.16. It is a
butterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by theisthmus. It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular
system. When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck.

Figure37.17The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior of the thyroid gland. (credit: modification of work by NCI)
The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium ion
levels fall below normal. PTH (1) enhances reabsorption of Ca2+by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity and inhibits
osteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances Ca2+absorption by
the digestive system. PTH is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid. PTH and calcitonin work in opposition to one another to
maintain homeostatic Ca2+levels in body fluids. Another type of cells, oxyphil cells, exist in the parathyroid but their function is
not known. These hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell formation in children and women.
Adrenal Glands
Theadrenal glandsare associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated inFigure 37.18. The
adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete different hormones.
Figure37.18The location of the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys is shown. (credit: modification of work by NCI)
Adrenal Cortex
Theadrenal cortexis made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks. These layers form three distinct
regions: an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids, a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids,
and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens.
The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of Na+ions in urine, sweat, pancreas, and saliva.
Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions, blood volume,
or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels.

Pineal Gland
The pineal gland produces melatonin. The rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod. Collaterals from the
visual pathways innervate the pineal gland. During the day photoperiod, little melatonin is produced; however, melatonin
production increases during the dark photoperiod (night). In some mammals, melatonin has an inhibitory affect on
reproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm, oocytes, and reproductive organs. Melatonin is an
effective antioxidant, protecting the CNS from free radicals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Lastly, melatonin is
involved in biological rhythms, particularly circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and eating habits.
Gonads
The gonads—the male testes and female ovaries—produce steroid hormones. The testes produce androgens, testosterone being
the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells. The
ovaries produce estradiol and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics and prepare the body for childbirth.

Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions
There are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. These include
the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.
The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. These cells release the
hormoneatrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)in response to increased blood volume. High blood volume causes the cells to be
stretched, resulting in hormone release. ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na+, causing Na+and water to be
excreted in the urine. ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal
cortex, further preventing the retention of water. In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and
reduces the concentration of Na+in the blood.
The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the
GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and
cholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas,
gallbladder, and liver. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.
While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are majorendocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess
endocrine function. Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na+and water, raising
blood volume. The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca2+and phosphate ions.Erythropoietin (EPO)
is a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO is released in response to low
oxygen levels. Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery throughout
the body. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater
endurance. Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks.
Thethymusis found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood. The
thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response.
Adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body. It produces the hormoneleptinin response to food intake.
Leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety
after eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. Leptin is also associated with reproduction. It
must be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if
adipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.

allow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton.

The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. It has five main functions: providing support to
the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The
skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and
the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).

Fourteenfacial bonesform the face, provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), protect the entrances to the
digestive and respiratory tracts, and serve as attachment points for facial muscles. The 14 facial bones are the nasal bones, the

Figure38.8(a) The vertebral column consists of seven cervical vertebrae (C1–7) twelve thoracic vertebrae (Th1–12), five lumbar vertebrae

Uwe Gille based on original work by Gray's Anatomy; credit b: modification of work by NCI, NIH)
Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. There is also a notch on each
side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral column is
approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The names of the
spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve
inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of
the body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a
spring (Figure 38.8).
Intervertebral discscomposed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the
sacrum. Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from
movements such as walking and running. Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. The inner part of
discs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. This loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb
shocks.
The Thoracic Cage
Thethoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae,
and costal cartilages (Figure 38.9). The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity, including the heart
and lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment point for the
diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing.
Thesternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. It is formed from three bones that fuse in the
adult. Theribsare 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body,
forming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of rib pairs 11 and

Thelower limbconsists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The bones of the lower limb are the femur (thigh bone), patella
(kneecap), tibia and fibula (bones of the leg), tarsals (bones of the ankle), and metatarsals and phalanges (bones of the foot)
(Figure 38.14). The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs because of the need to
support the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces from locomotion. In addition to evolutionary fitness, the bones of
an individual will respond to forces exerted upon them.

that lies anterior to the knee joint. The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps). It improves
knee extension by reducing friction. Thetibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee. The

• Explain the role of the different cell types in bone
• Explain how bone forms during development
Bone, orosseous tissue, is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton. It contains specialized cells and a matrix of
mineral salts and collagen fibers.
The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral formed from calcium phosphate.Calcificationis the process of
deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. The process of calcification only
occurs in the presence of collagen fibers.
The bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid
bones, and irregular bones (Figure 38.16).
Figure38.16Shown are different types of bones: flat, irregular, long, short, and sesamoid.

Figure38.18The patella of the knee is an example of a sesamoid bone.
Sutural bonesare small, flat, irregularly shaped bones. They may be found between the flat bones of the skull. They vary in
number, shape, size, and position.
Bone Tissue
Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone
tissue. Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact
and spongy.
Compact Bone Tissue
Compact bone(or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow.
It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems.
Osteonsare cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport
blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists oflamellae, which are layers of compact matrix
that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. TheHaversian canal(osteonic canal) contains the bone’s blood vessels
and nerve fibers (Figure 38.19). Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help
the bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied
in only a few directions.

Cell Types in Bones
Bone consists of four types of cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoprogenitor cells.Osteoblastsare bone cells that
are responsible for bone formation. Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular
matrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active
osteocytes.Osteoclastsare large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes
and acids that dissolve the bony matrix. These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium
concentrations in body fluids. Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have changed.Osteocytesare
mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide. Osteocytes maintain normal bone
structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix.Osteoprogenitor cellsare squamous stem cells that divide to produce
daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts. Osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures.
Development of Bone
Ossification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Ossification is distinct from the process of
calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. Ossification
begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of
fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous
ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth continues until approximately
age 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and
repair.
Intramembranous Ossification
Intramembranous ossificationis the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation of
the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the
future bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and
deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood
vessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus. The spongy bone
is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.
Endochondral Ossification
Endochondral ossificationis the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. All of the bones of the body, except for the
flat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification.

## Section 710.1
• Bone 1099
Bone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. Bones that are
not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass. A fractured or broken bone undergoes
repair through four stages:
1. Blood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at the
site of the break. The severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and bone cells
that are deprived of nutrients begin to die.
2. Within days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead cells.
Though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone.
Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone. The
repair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline and
fibrocartilage (Figure 38.22). Some bone spicules may also appear at this point.
3. The fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone. It takes about two months for the broken bone
ends to be firmly joined together after the fracture. This is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as cartilage
becomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix are present.
4. The bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and
within the medullary cavity being removed. Compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original,
unbroken bone. This remodeling can take many months, and the bone may remain uneven for years.
Figure38.22After this bone is set, a callus will knit the two ends together. (credit: Bill Rhodes)

Joints and Skeletal Movement
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Classify the different types of joints on the basis of structure
• Explain the role of joints in skeletal movement
The point at which two or more bones meet is called ajoint, orarticulation. Joints are responsible for movement, such as the
movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.
Classification of Joints on the Basis of Structure
There are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. The structural classification
divides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the
presence or absence of a cavity in the joint.
Fibrous Joints
The bones offibrous jointsare held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones
and so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. There are three types of fibrous joints:
sutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses.Suturesare found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that
hold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 38.23).
Figure38.23Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.
Syndesmosesare joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a
suture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in these types of
joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers.Gomphosesoccur between teeth and their sockets; the term
refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 38.24). The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue
referred to as the periodontal ligament.

Cartilaginous Joints
Cartilaginous jointsare joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints:
synchondroses and symphyses. In asynchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the
epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. Insymphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection
between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type of cartilaginous
joint allows for very little movement.
Synovial Joints
Synovial jointsare the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 38.25). This space is referred to as the
synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones
and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire
joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting
dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the
greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and
shoulders are examples of synovial joints.

Movement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation.
Special Movements
Some movements that cannot be classified as gliding, angular, or rotational are called special movements.Inversioninvolves
the soles of the feet moving inward, toward the midline of the body.Eversionis the opposite of inversion, movement of the sole
of the foot outward, away from the midline of the body.Protractionis the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane.
Retractionoccurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction. Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement
of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards.Elevationis the movement of a bone upward, such as
when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae.Depressionis the opposite of elevation—movement downward of a bone,
such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position.
Dorsiflexionis a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee.Plantar flexionis a bending at the ankle
when the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes.Supinationis the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the
forearm so that the palm faces forward.Pronationis the opposite movement, in which the palm faces backward.Oppositionis
the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand, making it possible to grasp and hold objects.
Types of Synovial Joints
Synovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint. The shape of
the joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint (Figure 38.26). These joints can be described as planar, hinge, pivot,
condyloid, saddle, or ball-and-socket joints.

Hinge Joints
Inhinge joints, the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone. In this way, one bone
moves while the other remains stationary, like the hinge of a door. The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. The knee is
sometimes classified as a modified hinge joint (Figure 38.28).

Pivot Joints
Pivot jointsconsist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone. This structure allows rotational
movement, as the rounded bone moves around its own axis. An example of a pivot joint is the joint of the first and second
vertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back and forth (Figure 38.29). The joint of the wrist that allows the palm of the
hand to be turned up and down is also a pivot joint.

Ball-and-Socket Joints
Ball-and-socket jointspossess a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone. This
organization allows the greatest range of motion, as all movement types are possible in all directions. Examples of ball-and-
socket joints are the shoulder and hip joints (Figure 38.32).

Muscle Contraction and Locomotion
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Classify the different types of muscle tissue
• Explain the role of muscles in locomotion
Muscle cells are specialized for contraction. Muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes
such as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth
muscle (Figure 38.33).
Figure38.33The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle, visualized here using
light microscopy. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one plump nucleus in each. Cardiac muscle cells are
branched and striated, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, and they have one nucleus in the center of the cell. (credit: modification of
work by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Skeletal muscle tissueforms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement that can
be consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle. Skeletal
muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated
appearance. The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin).Actinis a globular

contractile protein that interacts withmyosinfor muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single
cell.
Smooth muscle tissueoccurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around
passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels. Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control, has
only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called involuntary muscle.
Cardiac muscle tissueis only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood
pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously
controlled and is called involuntary muscle. It has one nucleus per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the presence of
intercalated disks.
Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure
Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 µm and lengths of
up to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called thesarcolemma. The sarcolemma is the site of action
potential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction. Within each muscle fiber aremyofibrils—long cylindrical structures
that lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber, and because they are only approximately

## Section 715.3
µm in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber. They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so
that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (Figure 38.34).
Figure38.34A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm.
A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.
The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are present
along the length of myofibrils. Dark A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the cell
causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded.
Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line. The Z discs mark the border of units
calledsarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle. One sarcomere is the space between two consecutive Z
discs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band, one on either side of the A band. A myofibril is composed of
many sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the myofibrils and muscle cells shorten
(Figure 38.35).

# Chapter 716

## Section 716.1
• Muscle Contraction and Locomotion 1111
Figure38.36When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller. The A band stays the same
width and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.
When a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length. A sarcomere is defined as the distance
between two consecutive Z discs or Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the Z discs is reduced. The H
zone—the central region of the A zone—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. The I band contains
only thin filaments and also shortens. The A band does not shorten—it remains the same length—but A bands of different
sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments
toward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of overlap, in which thin filaments
and thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.
ATP and Muscle Contraction
The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires energy,
which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site
for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.
ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly
bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The
i
energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a “cocked” position. The myosin head is then in
a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and P are still attached. If actin binding sites are
i
covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.
If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin

Regulatory Proteins
When a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are separated. To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin,
regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites.Tropomyosinblocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing
cross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input.Troponinbinds to tropomyosin and
helps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium ions.
To enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin
molecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. This can only happen in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low
concentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that
allow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin. Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can
form between actin and myosin, triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling continues until Ca2+ions and ATP are no longer
available and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.
Excitation–Contraction Coupling
Excitation–contraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the
start of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural
signal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the
muscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called themotor end plate. The end of
the neuron’s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space called the
synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the neuron’s axon, which
branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.
The ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their
cell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane. Each ion
exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence. Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir,
ions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly
mixed state.
The sodium–potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K+ions inside the cell and Na+ions outside. This alone accumulates
a small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. There is lots of K+in the cell and lots of Na+outside the cell.
Potassium is able to leave the cell through K+channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. However, Na+channels are
rarely open, so Na+remains outside the cell. When K+leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that effectively leaves a
negative charge behind. So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na+to enter the cell, and there is an accumulation
of negative charges left behind in the cell. This is the resting membrane potential. Potential in this context means a separation of
electrical charge that is capable of doing work. It is measured in volts, just like a battery. However, the transmembrane potential
is considerably smaller (0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is
negative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of negative charges inside the cell, −70 mV.
If an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na+ions, they will enter the cell. That will change the voltage. This is an
electrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal. Communication occurs between nerves and
muscles through neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic
terminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the
motor end plate. The motor end plate possesses junctional folds—folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the
neurotransmitter to bind to receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of Na+into the
cell when they receive a neurotransmitter signal.
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate.

immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to
transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another
action potential. The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. The
sodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+back out of the cell and K+back into the cell, and the K+leaks out leaving
negative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized.
Control of Muscle Tension
Neural control initiates the formation of actin–myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle
contraction. These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal
movement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. This enables
the same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced
depends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.
The number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can
produce. Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-
bridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced.
The ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the
greatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the
greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is
produced. As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed
of myosin tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the
tension produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each
other—reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched
to the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. This
amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose
extreme stretching.
The primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action
potential from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only
signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if
stimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber participates.
This is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials
(the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.

Systems of Gas Exchange
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the passage of air from the outside environment to the lungs
• Explain how the lungs are protected from particulate matter
The primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the cells of the body’s tissues and
remove carbon dioxide, a cell waste product. The main structures of the human respiratory system are the
nasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs.
All aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree,
different organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere.
The environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the
respiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances
increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops. In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell
membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (Figure 39.2). Diffusion is a slow, passive transport
process. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen
uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if the cell were very large or
thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore,
dependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only
for small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes).
Larger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages
accompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.
Figure39.2The cell of the unicellular algaVentricaria ventricosais one of the largest known, reaching one to five
centimeters in diameter. Like all single-celled organisms,V. ventricosaexchanges gases across the cell membrane.
Direct Diffusion
For small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen
needs. Gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm
in diameter. In simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the
external environment. Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are
small, literally flat worms, which ‘breathe’ through diffusion across the outer membrane (Figure 39.3). The
flat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for diffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body
is close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen. If the flatworm had a cylindrical body, then
the cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen.

Skin and Gills
Earthworms and amphibians use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ. A dense network of capillaries lies just below
the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory surface must
be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.
Organisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than
in the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much lower than that.
Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (Figure 39.4). Gills are thin
tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly
diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of
the body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid.
Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.
Figure39.4This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water. (credit:
"Guitardude012"/Wikimedia Commons)
The folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen. Diffusion is a process in
which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. In this case, blood
with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is
higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high
concentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown inFigure 39.5. Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules in the blood diffuse
from the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration).

a. When we breathe in, air travels from the pharynx to the trachea.
b. The bronchioles branch into bronchi.
c. Alveolar ducts connect to alveolar sacs.
d. Gas exchange between the lung and blood takes place in the alveolus.
From the nasal cavity, air passes through thepharynx(throat) and thelarynx(voice box), as it makes its way to thetrachea
(Figure 39.7). The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body.
The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from
the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. It is made of incomplete rings of
hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (Figure 39.8). The trachea is lined with mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia.
The cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. The cartilage provides strength and support to the
trachea to keep the passage open. The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the trachea’s diameter, which causes expired air
to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force. The forced exhalation helps expel mucus when we cough. Smooth muscle can
contract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or the body’s nervous system.

circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the
cells of the body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into
alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional
relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each
alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency. This organization
produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75
m2. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse
across the cells.
Figure39.10Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Each alveolar sac contains
20 to 30 spherical alveoli and has the appearance of a bunch of grapes. Air flows into the atrium of the alveolar sac, then circulates into
alveoli where gas exchange occurs with the capillaries. Mucous glands secrete mucous into the airways, keeping them moist and flexible.

Protective Mechanisms
The air that organisms breathe containsparticulate mattersuch as dust, dirt, viral particles, and bacteria that can damage the
lungs or trigger allergic immune responses. The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems
or tissue damage. In the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap small particles, viruses, bacteria, dust, and dirt to prevent their
entry.
If particulates do make it beyond the nose, or enter through the mouth, the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain
several protective devices. The lungs producemucus—a sticky substance made ofmucin, a complex glycoprotein, as well as salts
and water—that traps particulates. The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line the walls of
the bronchi and bronchioles (Figure 39.11). These cilia beat in unison and move mucus and particles out of the bronchi and
bronchioles back up to the throat where it is swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus.

Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Name and describe lung volumes and capacities
• Understand how gas pressure influences how gases move into and out of the body
The structure of the lung maximizes its surface area to increase gas diffusion. Because of the enormous number of alveoli
(approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m2). Having such a large surface
area increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs.
Basic Principles of Gas Exchange
Gas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion. Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a
concentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Blood that is
low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs. The air in
the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide.
This concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.
Partial pressureis a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. The total pressure exerted
by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. The rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional
to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture. This concept is discussed further in detail below.
Lung Volumes and Capacities
Different animals have different lung capacities based on their activities. Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung capacity
than humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. Elephants also have a high
lung capacity. In this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be able to take up oxygen
in accordance with their body size.
Human lung size is determined by genetics, sex, and height. At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters of
air, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. Air in the lungs is measured in terms oflung volumesandlung
capacities(Figure 39.12andTable 39.1). Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation or exhalation).
Capacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal exhalation).

When the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified. The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change the
pressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation. For this calculation, the water pressure (47 mm Hg)
is subtracted from the atmospheric pressure:
and the partial pressure of oxygen is:
These pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system. Oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow according to
their pressure gradient from high to low. Therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in understanding
how gases move in the respiratory system.
Gas Exchange across the Alveoli
In the body, oxygen is used by cells of the body’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. The ratio of carbon
dioxide production to oxygen consumption is therespiratory quotient (RQ). RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0. If just glucose were
used to fuel the body, the RQ would equal one. One mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole of oxygen
consumed. Glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body. Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body. Because of this,
less carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the RQ is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and about 0.8 for protein.
The RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, thealveolar . Above, the
partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg. However, lungs never fully deflate with an exhalation;
therefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the alveoli. This means
that there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body. Knowing the RQ, the partial
pressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated:
With an RQ of 0.8 and a in the alveoli of 40 mm Hg, the alveolar is equal to:
Notice that this pressure is less than the external air. Therefore, the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the lung ( = 150
mm Hg) into the bloodstream ( = 100 mm Hg) (Figure 39.13).
In the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Oxygen (about 98 percent) binds
reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues where
oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar is higher in the
alveoli ( = 100 mm Hg) than blood (40 mm Hg) in the capillaries. Because this pressure gradient exists, oxygen
diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the capillaries where O binds to
2
hemoglobin. At the same time, alveolar is lower = 40 mm Hg than blood = (45 mm Hg). CO diffuses down
2
its pressure gradient, moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other; they diffuse down their own pressure gradients. As blood leaves
the lungs through the pulmonary veins, thevenous = 100 mm Hg, whereas thevenous = 40 mm Hg. As blood enters

## Section 732.2
• Breathing 1135
Mammalian lungs are located in the thoracic cavity where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal
muscles, and bound by the chest wall. The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that facilitates
breathing. Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm.
Types of Breathing
Amphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing. Young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they don’t leave
the water. Some amphibians retain gills for life. As the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow. These lungs are
primitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs. Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via
lungs is forced. The other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin. To aid this diffusion, amphibian skin
must remain moist.
Birds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: They fly. Flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds
require a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes. Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with the
oxygen needed to enable flying. Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange.
Oxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide
diffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. The details of breathing between birds and mammals
differ substantially.
In addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and
out of the anterior air sacs. The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place much more
efficiently. This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where the oxygen
concentration is low. This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of
the lungs.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Avian Respiration
Birds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. Flying is a high-energy process and requires a lot of oxygen.
Furthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen is low. How did birds evolve a respiratory
system that is so unique?
Decades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating dinosaurs (Figure 39.14). In
fact, fossil evidence shows that meat-eating dinosaurs that lived more than 100 million years ago had a similar flow-through
respiratory system with lungs and air sacs.ArchaeopteryxandXiaotingia, for example, were flying dinosaurs and are believed
to be early precursors of birds.

No units are given as Boyle used arbitrary units in his experiments.
There is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open.
During inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according to Boyle’s
Law). This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere
(Figure 39.16a). Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. To increase the volume of the lungs,
the chest wall expands. This results from the contraction of theintercostal muscles, the muscles that are connected to the rib
cage. Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostal muscles contract, thus expanding the thoracic
cavity. This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere, so air rushes into the
lungs, thus increasing its volume. The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an increase in alveolar space, because
the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.
Figure39.16The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration. (credit: modification
of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs. The lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, theelastic recoil
within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces compete to
inflate and deflate the lung with every breath. Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs, and the
intercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 39.16b). The diaphragm also relaxes and
moves higher into the thoracic cavity. This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment, and air
rushes out of the lungs. The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. No muscles are contracting to expel the air.
Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac. The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral
pleura. A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax (Figure 39.17). The space between these layers, the
intrapleural space, contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the
tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax.Pleurisyresults when these layers of tissue become inflamed; it is painful
because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung.

Lung Resistance and Compliance
Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs. Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are
compliance(how elastic the lung is) andresistance(how much obstruction exists in the airways). A change in either can
dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.
Examples ofrestrictive diseasesare respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. In both diseases, the airways are
less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. There is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move. In
these types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation, which
traps air in the lungs. Forced orfunctional vital capacity (FVC), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after
taking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is
greatly prolonged (Figure 39.18). A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of air.
Obstructive diseasesand conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. In emphysema, which mostly arises
from smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. The overall
compliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a loss of
elastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Asthma is a disease in which inflammation is
triggered by environmental factors. Inflammation obstructs the airways. The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid
accumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of the
airways, or a combination of these events. Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased
inflammation of the airways. This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 39.18). Those
with obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume to
compensate for the lack of airway recruitment.
Figure39.18The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep breath) to FVC (the total
amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diagnose whether a person has restrictive or obstructive lung disease. In
restrictive lung disease, FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed, so the person is able to expel air reasonably fast. In obstructive lung
disease, airway obstruction results in slow exhalation as well as reduced FVC. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive
lung disease (less than 69 percent) than in persons with restrictive disease (88 to 90 percent).
Dead Space: V/Q Mismatch
Pulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation. It is also independent of cardiac
output. This is because of a phenomenon calledrecruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain
closed when cardiac output increases. As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused
(filled with blood) increases. These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. At times, however, there
is a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs. This is referred to
asventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
There are two types of V/Q mismatch. Both producedead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue. Dead spaces can

Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how oxygen is bound to hemoglobin and transported to body tissues
• Explain how carbon dioxide is transported from body tissues to the lungs
Once the oxygen diffuses across the alveoli, it enters the bloodstream and is transported to the tissues where it is unloaded, and
carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be expelled from the body. Although gas exchange is a continuous
process, the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different mechanisms.
Transport of Oxygen in the Blood
Although oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way. Only 1.5 percent of oxygen in the
blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself. Most oxygen—98.5 percent—is bound to a protein called hemoglobin and carried
to the tissues.
Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits and
two beta subunits (Figure 39.19). Each subunit surrounds a centralheme groupthat contains iron and binds one oxygen
molecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme
groups are brighter red. As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red,
while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.

Figure39.19The protein inside (a) red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and carbon dioxide to the lungs is (b) hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is made up of four symmetrical subunits and four heme groups. Iron associated with the heme binds oxygen. It is the iron in
hemoglobin that gives blood its red color.
It is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to Hb than the first molecule. This is because the hemoglobin molecule
changes its shape, or conformation, as oxygen binds. The fourth oxygen is then more difficult to bind. The binding of oxygen to
hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (x-axis) versus the relative Hb-oxygen
saturation (y-axis). The resulting graph—anoxygen dissociation curve—is sigmoidal, or S-shaped (Figure 39.20). As the partial
pressure of oxygen increases, the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure39.20The oxygen dissociation curve demonstrates that, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases, more oxygen binds hemoglobin.
However, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen may shift to the left or the right depending on environmental conditions.
The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen to blood pH and
to hemoglobin affinity for oxygen?
Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding
Theoxygen-carrying capacityof hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to , other
environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery.
Carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 39.20). When carbon dioxide is

The benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is “soaked up” into the blood with little change to the pH of
the system. This is important because it takes only a small change in the overall pH of the body for severe injury or death to
result. The presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes: When the partial
pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate carbon
dioxide while maintaining the correct pH in the body.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
While carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO)
cannot. Carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Therefore, when carbon monoxide is present, it
binds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen. As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen is
transported through the body (Figure 39.22). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to detect. It
is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term
exposure can cause brain damage or death. Administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for carbon
monoxide poisoning. Administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.
Figure39.22As percent CO increases, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin decreases.

Figure40.3Simple animals consisting of a single cell layer such as the (a) sponge or only a few cell layers such as the (b) jellyfish do not
have a circulatory system. Instead, gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged by diffusion.
For more complex organisms, diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases, nutrients, and waste effectively through the body;
therefore, more complex circulatory systems evolved. Most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory systems. In an
open system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions help to move fluids.
The larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push blood through their
bodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and are able to move rapidly to
catch prey. Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the
structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptation during evolution
and associated differences in anatomy.Figure 40.4illustrates the basic circulatory systems of some vertebrates: fish,
amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.

# Chapter 744

## Section 744.1
• Components of the Blood 1153
In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart,
which is calledpulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain
(systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred
to aspulmocutaneous circulation.
As shown inFigure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-
chambered heart of fish. The twoatria(superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the
systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’sventricle(inferior heart chamber), which reduces the
efficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and
body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory
system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having
double circulation.
Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and
systemic circuits, as shown inFigure 40.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less
mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to
exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs
toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays
underwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes
blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations
include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side
of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations
have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth.
In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated inFigure 40.4d.
The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is
probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals
evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is
referred to as convergent evolution.

## Section 744.2
Components of the Blood
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• List the basic components of the blood
• Compare red and white blood cells
• Describe blood plasma and serum
Hemoglobin is responsible for distributing oxygen, and to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide, throughout the circulatory systems of
humans, vertebrates, and many invertebrates. The blood is more than the proteins, though. Blood is actually a term used to
describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includesplasma(the liquid portion, which contains water, proteins, salts,
lipids, and glucose) and the cells (red and white cells) and cell fragments calledplatelets. Blood plasma is actually the dominant
component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells are responsible for carrying the
gases (red cells) and the immune response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood clotting. Interstitial fluid that
surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. In humans, cellular components make up
approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. Blood is 20 percent of a person’s extracellular fluid and
eight percent of weight.
The Role of Blood in the Body
Blood, like the human blood illustrated inFigure 40.5is important for regulation of the body’s systems and homeostasis. Blood
helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat. Blood supports
growth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste. Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting
factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents orwhite blood cellsto sites of infection.

# Chapter 745

## Section 745.1
• Components of the Blood 1155
Figure40.6In most vertebrates, (a) hemoglobin delivers oxygen to the body and removes some carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin is composed
of four protein subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and a heme group that has iron associated with it. The iron reversibly
associates with oxygen, and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2+to Fe3+. In most mollusks and some arthropods, (b) hemocyanin delivers
oxygen. Unlike hemoglobin, hemolymph is not carried in blood cells, but floats free in the hemolymph. Copper instead of iron binds the
oxygen, giving the hemolymph a blue-green color. In annelids, such as the earthworm, and some other invertebrates, (c) hemerythrin
carries oxygen. Like hemoglobin, hemerythrin is carried in blood cells and has iron associated with it, but despite its name, hemerythrin
does not contain heme.
The small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the plasma
membrane. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. In the tissues, oxygen is released from
the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. Studies have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous
oxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of
red blood cells through narrow vessels. Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart attacks, is converted to NO to
help relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.
A characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have
carbohydrate molecules attached. In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between
individuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, and O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days, at
which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood cell.
White Blood Cells
White blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in blood. The
role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune response to
identify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. White blood cells are formed
continually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.
The morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. They have nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin.
The different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining, and each has a
different specialized function. The two main groups, both illustrated inFigure 40.7are the granulocytes, which include the
neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and lymphocytes.

• Components of the Blood 1157
Figure40.8(a) Platelets are formed from large cells called megakaryocytes. The megakaryocyte breaks up into thousands of fragments
that become platelets. (b) Platelets are required for clotting of the blood. The platelets collect at a wound site in conjunction with other
clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, to form a fibrin clot that prevents blood loss and allows the wound to heal.
Plasma and Serum
The liquid component of blood is called plasma, and it is separated by spinning or centrifuging the blood at high rotations (3000
rpm or higher). The blood cells and platelets are separated by centrifugal forces to the bottom of a specimen tube. The upper
liquid layer, the plasma, consists of 90 percent water along with various substances required for maintaining the body’s pH,
osmotic load, and for protecting the body. The plasma also contains the coagulation factors and antibodies.
The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called theserum. Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in
which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves. Other
components in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining pH and osmotic balance while giving viscosity to the
blood. The serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and bacteria.
Lipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including nutrients,
hormones, metabolic waste, plus external substances, such as, drugs, viruses, and bacteria.
Human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and is synthesized in the liver. Albumin, which
constitutes about half of the blood serum protein, transports hormones and fatty acids, buffers pH, and maintains osmotic
pressures. Immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody
mediated immunity.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Blood Types Related to Proteins on the Surface of the Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The composition of these molecules is determined
by genetics, which have evolved over time. In humans, the different surface antigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups
with more than 100 different antigens on each red blood cell. The two most well known blood groups are the ABO, shown in
Figure 40.9, and Rh systems. The surface antigens in the ABO blood group are glycolipids, called antigen A and antigen B. People
with blood type A have antigen A, those with blood type B have antigen B, those with blood type AB have both antigens, and
people with blood type O have neither antigen. Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in the blood plasma and react with
the A or B antigens, if the two are mixed. When type A and type B blood are combined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood
occurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with the opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney
causing kidney failure. Type O blood has neither A or B antigens, and therefore, type O blood can be given to all blood types.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the structure of the heart and explain how cardiac muscle is different from other muscles
• Describe the cardiac cycle

The heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system: the coronary (vessels that
serve the heart), pulmonary (heart and lungs), and systemic (systems of the body), as shown inFigure 40.10. Coronary
circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. For pulmonary and
systemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. In vertebrates, the lungs are
relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of
the heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe.

Figure40.10The mammalian circulatory system is divided into three circuits: the systemic circuit, the pulmonary circuit, and the coronary
circuit. Blood is pumped from veins of the systemic circuit into the right atrium of the heart, then into the right ventricle. Blood then enters
the pulmonary circuit, and is oxygenated by the lungs. From the pulmonary circuit, blood reenters the heart through the left atrium. From
the left ventricle, blood reenters the systemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body. The coronary circuit, which
provides blood to the heart, is not shown.

Structure of the Heart
The heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since the
right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the
whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown inFigure 40.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is
divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium
and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump
blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from thesuperior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that
comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from theinferior vena cavawhich drains blood
from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary
sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through
theatrioventricular valveor thetricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the
backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve.
After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, bypassing thesemilunar valve(or
pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves
close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood
from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through thebicuspid valveor mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve
on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through theaorta, the major artery of the body,
taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the
aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This
pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.

inner wall of the heart has a lining called theendocardium. Themyocardiumconsists of the heart muscle cells that make up the
middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall. The outer layer of cells is called theepicardium, of which the second layer is a
membranous layered structure called thepericardiumthat surrounds and protects the heart; it allows enough room for
vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures.
The heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. Thecoronary arteriesbranch from the aorta and
surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown. They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with
oxygen before converging again into thecoronary veinsto take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood
will be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit. The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood.
Atherosclerosisis the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques. Because of the size (narrow) of the coronary arteries
and their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries. The slowdown of blood flow and
subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known asangina, and complete blockage of
the arteries will causemyocardial infarction: the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known as a heart attack.
The Cardiac Cycle
The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. The
cardiac cycleis the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart
muscles to contract and relax. The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. In each cardiac cycle, the heart contracts
(systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase (diastole), where the
heart fills with blood, as illustrated inFigure 40.12. The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood through the
atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic “lup” sound. Following
a brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery
transporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery). Closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic “dup”
sound.
Figure40.12During (a) cardiac diastole, the heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart. During (b) atrial systole, the atria
contract, pushing blood into the ventricles. During (c) atrial diastole, the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart.
The pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle.
Cardiomyocytes, shown inFigure 40.13, are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically
and involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle. They are self-
stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes.

Arteries, Veins, and Capillaries
The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels (Figure 40.15).Arteriestake blood
away from the heart. The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs.
These major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain, the brachial arteries that take blood to the arms,
and the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic, renal, and gastric arteries for the liver, kidney,
and stomach, respectively. The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and
then smaller vessels calledarterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.

## Section 750.2
Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the system of blood flow through the body
• Describe how blood pressure is regulated
Blood pressure (BP)is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through the body.
Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating. The optimal
systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats. The
optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating,
sitting, and standing. Blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the action of smooth muscle, by
one-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself.
How Blood Flows Through the Body
Blood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart. With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under high
pressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. In the aorta, the blood travels at 30 cm/sec.
As blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows dramatically to
about 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. While the diameter of each individual
arteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity, fluid should travel
faster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries
being far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.
The slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient
exchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. After the blood has passed through the capillary
beds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than the
initial rate in the aorta. Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and
by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity, blood is
prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow,
it is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities.
Blood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the body’s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals.
For example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the digestive system
and vasoconstriction of other vessels. During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood
to the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction. The blood entering some capillary beds is controlled by
small muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated inFigure 40.17. If the sphincters are open, the blood will flow into the

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Vertebrate Diversity in Blood Circulation
Blood circulation has evolved differently in vertebrates and may show variation in different animals for the required amount of
pressure, organ and vessel location, and organ size. Animals with longs necks and those that live in cold environments have
distinct blood pressure adaptations.
Long necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. The blood pressure required
from the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg (mm Hg = millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure)
to reach the height of a giraffe’s head, which is 2.5 meters higher than the heart. However, if checks and balances were not in
place, this blood pressure would damage the giraffe’s brain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. These checks and
balances include valves and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. Long-necked dinosaurs such as the
sauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. This would have required a blood pressure of more
than 600 mm Hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart. Evidence for such an enormous heart does not
exist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. It
is likely that they did not routinely feed on tree tops but grazed on the ground.
Living in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. This is achieved by the veins and arteries being
close together so that heat exchange can occur. This mechanism is called a countercurrent heat exchanger. The blood vessels and
the whole body are also protected by thick layers of blubber to prevent heat loss. In land animals that live in cold environments,
thick fur and hibernation are used to retain heat and slow metabolism.
Blood Pressure
The pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of the
blood vessels. Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures. In the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure near the
heart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles.
During systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the
extra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties. The blood pressure of the systole
phase and the diastole phase, graphed inFigure 40.19, gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure. For example, 120/80
indicates a reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole. Throughout the cardiac cycle, the blood
continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate. This resistance to blood flow is calledperipheral resistance.

Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define osmosis and explain its role within molecules
• Explain why osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important body functions
• Describe active transport mechanisms
• Explain osmolarity and the way in which it is measured
• Describe osmoregulators or osmoconformers and how these tools allow animals to adapt to
different environments
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response toosmotic pressurecaused by an
imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane.Osmoregulationis the process of maintenance of
salt and water balance (osmotic balance) across membranes within the body’s fluids, which are composed of
water, plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes. Anelectrolyteis a solute that dissociates into ions when
dissolved in water. Anon-electrolyte, in contrast, doesn’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution. Both
electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. The body’s fluids include blood plasma,
the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of
the body. The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) aresemi-permeable
membranes. Semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and
water. Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by
movement of solutes and/or water across the membrane. As seen inFigure 41.2, a cell placed in water tends
to swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic or “low salt” environment. A cell placed in a solution with
higher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water
into the hypertonic or “high salt” environment. Isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside
and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semi-
permeable membrane.
Figure41.2Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water. In a hypotonic environment,
cells tend to swell due to intake of water. The blood maintains an isotonic environment so that cells neither shrink nor
swell. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
The body does not exist in isolation. There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system.
While osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are
transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance.

## Section 758.2
• Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance 1175
Need for Osmoregulation
Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food
and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or
when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire
consequences.
Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific
concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and
intracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid
compartments can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a
direct bearing on blood pressure.
Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes
Electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. In water, sodium
chloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na+) and the chloride ion (Cl–). The most important ions, whose concentrations
are very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and
the anions chloride (Cl-), carbonate (CO-2), bicarbonate (HCO-), and phosphate(PO-). Electrolytes are lost from the body
3 3 3
during urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of
increased activity and perspiration.
Osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to the number of solute
atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Because electrolytes dissociate into their component
ions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure, per mass than
compounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.
Water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would
be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms
to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active
transport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport requires energy in the
form of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient.
Concept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent
In order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for
measuring solutes is themole. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular
weight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. Themolarityof a solution is the
number of moles of solute per liter of solution. Themolalityof a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of
solvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used to
express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter
(mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion.
The unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous
solutions) and the charge on the ions.
Thus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two (like
calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the
milliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually
maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.
Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers
Persons lost at sea without any freshwater to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to
drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a
relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either
freshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for a few
fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in freshwater and part in seawater. Organisms like the salmon and molly that can
tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because some fish have

The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain how the kidneys serve as the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems
• Describe the structure of the kidneys and the functions of the parts of the kidney
• Describe how the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and explain how it actively filters blood and
generates urine
• Detail the three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular
secretion
Although the kidneys are the major osmoregulatory organ, the skin and lungs also play a role in the process. Water and
electrolytes are lost through sweat glands in the skin, which helps moisturize and cool the skin surface, while the lungs expel a
small amount of water in the form of mucous secretions and via evaporation of water vapor.
Kidneys: The Main Osmoregulatory Organ
Thekidneys, illustrated inFigure 41.4, are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver
in the peritoneal cavity. The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys filter
blood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25
percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently
manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration. The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called
urine.

Which of the following statements about the nephron is false?
a. The collecting duct empties into the distal convoluted tubule.
b. The Bowman’s capsule surrounds the glomerulus.
c. The loop of Henle is between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.
d. The loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule.
Renal Corpuscle
The renal corpuscle, located in the renal cortex, is made up of a network of capillaries known as theglomerulusand the capsule,
a cup-shaped chamber that surrounds it, called the glomerular orBowman's capsule.
Renal Tubule
The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based
on function. The first part is called theproximal convoluted tubule (PCT)due to its proximity to the glomerulus; it stays in the
renal cortex. The second part is called theloop of Henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (withdescendingand
ascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla. The third part of the renal tubule is called thedistal convoluted tubule
(DCT)and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex. The DCT, which is the last part of the nephron, connects and empties its
contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids. The collecting ducts amass contents from multiple nephrons
and fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla.
Capillary Network within the Nephron
The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered. The
branch that enters the glomerulus is called theafferent arteriole. The branch that exits the glomerulus is called theefferent
arteriole. Within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed. Once the efferent arteriole
exits the glomerulus, it forms theperitubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule.
In cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT. In juxtamedullary nephrons, the
peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called thevasa recta.

Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion
Tubular reabsorption occurs in the PCT part of the renal tubule. Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by
passive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones.
Sodium (Na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular
capillaries. Because Na+is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. Water is also
independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT. This
occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. However, every solute has a
transport maximumand the excess is not reabsorbed.
In the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the
opposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt
concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient increases as it
moves deeper into the medulla. Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as illustrated inFigure 41.8,
it acts as acountercurrent multiplier. The vasa recta around it acts as thecountercurrent exchanger.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure41.8The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration gradients. The descending limb
is water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal
medulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na+
and Cl-ions exit through ion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na+is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl-
follows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).
Loop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension. These drugs inhibit the reabsorption of Na+and Cl-ions by the
ascending limb of the loop of Henle. A side effect is that they increase urination. Why do you think this is the case?
By the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body requires additional
water, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later
section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like
metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in

• Explain how insects use Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance
Microorganisms and invertebrate animals use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of their metabolic wastes than
the mammalian system of kidney and urinary function. Three excretory systems evolved in organisms before complex kidneys:
vacuoles, flame cells, and Malpighian tubules.
Contractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms
The most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. In other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a life.
Bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however, prokaryotes
such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are
bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some leucocytes in humans, are
able to engulf food by endocytosis—the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells. The same
vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. In some unicellular eukaryotic
organisms such as the amoeba, shown inFigure 41.9, cellular wastes and excess water are excreted by exocytosis, when the
contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment. Contractile vacuoles (CV) should not
be confused with vacuoles, which store food or water.

Figure41.9Some unicellular organisms, such as the amoeba, ingest food by endocytosis. The food vesicle fuses with a lysosome, which
digests the food. Waste is excreted by exocytosis.
Flame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms
As multicellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs evolved
to perform the excretory function. Planaria are flatworms that live in freshwater. Their excretory system consists of two tubules
connected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are calledflame cells(orprotonephridia) because they have
a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated inFigure 41.10a. The cilia
propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw
water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption. Flame cells are
found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They also maintain the organism’s osmotic balance.
Figure41.10In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed by a tube cell. Tubules
are connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the body. The filtrate is secreted through these
pores. In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the coelom, or body cavity. Beating cilia at the opening of the
nephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule. As the filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed
by capillaries. Filtered fluid containing nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of
the body.
Earthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures callednephridia, illustrated inFigure 41.10b. A pair of
nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm. They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia.
Excretion occurs through a pore called thenephridiopore. They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system
for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion.
Malpighian Tubules of Insects
Malpighian tubulesare found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated inFigure 41.11. They are
usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted, which
increases their surface area, and they are lined withmicrovillifor reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance.
Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. Body fluids are not filtered as in the
case of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that are bathed
in hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks).

Nitrogenous Wastes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Compare and contrast the way in which aquatic animals and terrestrial animals can eliminate toxic ammonia
from their systems
• Compare the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in vertebrate animals to that of birds, insects, and
reptiles
Of the four major macromolecules in biological systems, both proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen. During the
catabolism, or breakdown, of nitrogen-containing macromolecules, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in
the form of carbohydrates and fats. Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body. Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxicammonia,
which raises the pH of body fluids. The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of
water to dilute it out of a biological system. Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water.
Animals that excrete ammonia are said to beammonotelic. Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete
nitrogenous wastes. The animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric
acid. Mammals, including humans, produce urea, whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid.
Animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are calledureotelicanimals.
Nitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals: The Urea Cycle
Theurea cycleis the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea. Urea is made in the liver and excreted in
urine. The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH (ammonia) + CO + 3 ATP + H O → H N-

The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in
Figure 41.12. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the
urea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key
step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. The first two reactions
occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. Urea concentration in the blood, calledblood urea
nitrogenor BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function.
Figure41.12The urea cycle converts ammonia to urea.
EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Excretion of Nitrogenous Waste
The theory of evolution proposes that life started in an aquatic environment. It is not surprising to see that biochemical
pathways like the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial life forms evolved. Arid conditions
probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of conserving water.

## Section 764.2
• Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions 1187
Hormones are small molecules that act as messengers within the body. Hormones are typically secreted from one cell and travel
in the bloodstream to affect a target cell in another portion of the body. Different regions of the nephron bear specialized cells
that have receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones.Table 41.1summarizes the hormones that control the
osmoregulatory functions.

Table41.1
Epinephrine and Norepinephrine
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla and nervous system respectively. They are the flight/fight
hormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress. During stress, much of the body’s energy is used to combat
imminent danger. Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones function by
acting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict them. Once the afferent arterioles are constricted, blood flow
into the nephrons stops. These hormones go one step further and trigger therenin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem.
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, illustrated inFigure 41.15proceeds through several steps to produceangiotensin II,
which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume. Renin (secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex) is produced by the
granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles. Thus, the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly. Renin acts on
angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver and converts it toangiotensin I.Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)converts
angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. It also triggers the release of
the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium.
Angiotensin II also triggers the release ofanti-diuretic hormone (ADH)from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in
the kidneys. It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate. Medically, blood pressure can be controlled
by drugs that inhibit ACE (called ACE inhibitors).

immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient
response upon reexposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such
as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for
survival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate
immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing
on specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections
and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.

## Section 771.1
Innate Immune Response
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe physical and chemical immune barriers
• Explain immediate and induced innate immune responses
• Discuss natural killer cells
• Describe major histocompatibility class I molecules
• Summarize how the proteins in a complement system function to destroy extracellular
pathogens
The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses.Innate immunityoccurs
naturally because of genetic factors or physiology; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to
reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response. Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune
response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication.
The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential
response to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat
triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection
independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus
secretions contain microbicidal factors.
Physical and Chemical Barriers
Before any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to
potentially infectious pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out)
and by the skin’s acidity. In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with
invading pathogens, preventing infection. Regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the
eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that
trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus
with the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the
stomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell
membranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).
Despite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting
on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved
specific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter
the body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of
immune factors and proteins.
Pathogen Recognition
An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and
replicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate
intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. The innate immune system must respond
accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been
infected. When a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and lymph detect the specificpathogen-
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)on the pathogen’s surface. PAMPs are carbohydrate, polypeptide,
and nucleic acid “signatures” that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which differ from
molecules on host cells. The immune system has specific cells, described inFigure 42.2and shown inFigure
42.3, with receptors that recognize these PAMPs. Amacrophageis a large phagocytic cell that engulfs
foreign particles and pathogens. Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementarypattern recognition
receptors (PRRs). PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the
external environment. Amonocyteis a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and
differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue. Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures
of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a type of
PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules. TLRs
are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components of

Figure42.4Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus. Response of neighboring cells to interferon helps
stem the infection.
Phagocytosis and Inflammation
The first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourageinflammation, the localized redness, swelling,
heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of
infection. The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen. Both
macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis. Aneutrophilis also a phagocytic
leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils, shown inFigure 42.3, are the most abundant leukocytes of the
immune system. Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called lysosomes, that digest
engulfed pathogens. Aneosinophilis a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite; it is involved in the
allergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms).
Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. A
mast cellis a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens. Abasophilis
a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated inFigure 42.5.
Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses.
Eosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes. A hypersensitive immune
response to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells.
Figure42.5In response to a cut, mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate. Neutrophils and monocytes leave the
capillaries. Monocytes mature into macrophages. Neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages release chemicals to stimulate the
inflammatory response. Neutrophils and macrophages also consume invading bacteria by phagocytosis.
Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which include

• Innate Immune Response 1199
Complement
An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called acomplement system, functions to destroy extracellular
pathogens. Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the
blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so named
because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind to the
surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies. Binding of
complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated by
cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s). After the first few complement proteins
bind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins.
Complement proteins perform several functions. The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to
phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and B cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is calledopsonization. Certain
complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes. These structures
destroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated inFigure 42.7.

response; however, adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory.Adaptive immunityis an immunity that
occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination. This part of the immune system is activated when
the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. In fact, without information from the innate immune
system, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. There are two types of adaptive responses: thecell-mediated immune
response, which is carried out by T cells, and thehumoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and
antibodies. Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the
invading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens
and disrupt the infection. Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from
reinfection with the same type of pathogen; on reexposure, this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response.
Antigen-presenting Cells
Unlike NK cells of the innate immune system, B cells (B lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that gives rise to antibodies,
whereas T cells (T lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune response. T cells are a
key component in the cell-mediated response—the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to neutralize cells that have
been infected with viruses and certain bacteria. There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor T cells.
Cytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T cells play a part in activating
both the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor T cells deactivate T cells and B cells when needed, and
thus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.
Anantigenis a foreign or “non-self” macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. Not all antigens will provoke a
response. For instance, individuals produce innumerable “self” antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless foreign
antigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. The suppression of immune responses to harmless
macromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.
The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune
response about the presence of these antigens. Anantigen-presenting cell (APC)is an immune cell that detects, engulfs, and
informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose the
pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. Antigen fragments will then be transported to the
surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells.Dendritic cellsare immune cells that process
antigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.
Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning as an antigen-
presenting cell. Macrophages also function as APCs. Before activation and differentiation, B cells can also function as APCs.
After phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. Within the
phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC
class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated inFigure 42.8. Note that T
lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule. APCs express
MHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a “non-self” invader. Once the
fragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond. Helper T cells are one of the main
lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed MHC I
molecules, which signal “healthy” or “normal.”

population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing
virtually any infecting pathogen. T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens, calledepitopes,
presented by APCs, illustrated inFigure 42.10. Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire
antigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as “antigenic determinants.” In the absence of information from APCs, T and B cells
remain inactive, or naïve, and are unable to prepare an immune response. The requirement for information from the APCs of
innate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the innate immune response to the
functioning of the entire immune system.
Figure42.10An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system. A given antigen may contain several
motifs that are recognized by immune cells. Each motif is an epitope. In this figure, the entire structure is an antigen, and the orange,
salmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes.
Naïve T cells can express one of two different molecules, CD4 or CD8, on their surface, as shown inFigure 42.11, and are
accordingly classified as CD4+or CD8+cells. These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with
and respond to an APC. Naïve CD4+cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to
becomehelper T (T ) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate B cells (or cytotoxic T cells) directly or secrete cytokines to
H
inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat. In contrast, CD8+cells engage antigen-embedded MHC I
molecules on APCs and are stimulated to becomecytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis
and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response. The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune
protection, but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors (TCRs). The CD4 or CD8 surface
molecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule. Because they assist in binding
specificity, the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors.

When stimulated by the T 2 pathway, naïve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Aplasma cellis an

immune cell that secrets antibodies; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens. Similar to T cells, naïve B
cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors (BCRs), which are membrane-bound forms of Ig (immunoglobulin, or
an antibody). The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages. Each chain has a
constant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding. Two other membrane proteins, Ig alpha and Ig beta, are
involved in signaling. The receptors of any particular B cell, as shown inFigure 42.13are all the same, but the hundreds of
millions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types
of molecular structures to which they can bind. In this state, B cells function as APCs. They bind and engulf foreign antigens via
their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to T 2 cells. When a T 2 cell detects that a B
H H
cell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes
thousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition
pattern as the BCRs. The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that
variant is known asclonal selection. This phenomenon drastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of BCR variants
expressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen.

Based on what you know about MHC receptors, why do you think an organ transplanted from an incompatible donor to a
recipient will be rejected?
Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively calledeffector cells: they represent differentiated versions of their naïve counterparts, and
they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells.
Mucosal Surfaces and Immune Tolerance
The innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system (affecting the whole
body), which is distinct from the mucosal immune system. Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue,
which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components.
Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), illustrated inFigure 42.15, is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with
epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of
the body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell
types. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to
APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. M cells function in the transport described, and are located in the Peyer’s patch,
a lymphoid nodule. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with B cells and macrophages having
minor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites,
such as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine. Activated T cells then migrate through
the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection.

has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis.
Immunological Memory
The adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon
reinvasion of the same pathogen. Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the innate
response. During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary response,
plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells mature into effector
cells, a subset of the naïve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities, as illustrated
inFigure 42.16.
Amemory cellis an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary
immune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon reexposure to the same pathogen. During the primary
immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. As the infection is cleared
and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the memory cells
persist in the circulation.

helper T cell recognizes the MHC II–antigen complex and activates the B cell. As a result, memory B cells and plasma cells are made.

Vaccinologists are involved in the process of vaccine development from the initial idea to the availability of the completed
vaccine. This process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve many obstacles along the way. For instance,
injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system, eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on
the mucosal response, which presents a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal
compartments, and the injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. For this reason,
vaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol, oral, or transcutaneous
(absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. Importantly, mucosal-administered vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic
immunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as injected vaccines.
Figure42.19The polio vaccine can be administered orally. (credit: modification of work by UNICEF Sverige)
Currently, a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available, and the polio and typhoid vaccines can be administered orally, as
shown inFigure 42.19. Similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices.
Eventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to produce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance.
Other vaccines may be adapted to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or
reproductive mucosa. Finally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped
and microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune response, this new
generation of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn, improve patient participation.

Figure42.21The spleen is similar to a lymph node but is much larger and filters blood instead of lymph. Blood enters the spleen through
arteries and exits through veins. The spleen contains two types of tissue: red pulp and white pulp. Red pulp consists of cavities that store
blood. Within the red pulp, damaged red blood cells are removed and replaced by new ones. White pulp is rich in lymphocytes that remove
antigen-coated bacteria from the blood. (credit: modification of work by NCI)

## Section 780.2
Antibodies
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain cross-reactivity
• Describe the structure and function of antibodies
• Discuss antibody production
Anantibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an
antigen. Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity. Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus
secretions, and in breast milk. Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by
phagocytes before they can infect cells.
Antibody Structure
An antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: two identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially bound
to each other in a “Y” formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units), as illustrated inFigure
42.22. Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other. The areas where
the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant domains.
In germ-line B cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (V) and five joining (J) segments. An enzyme called
DNA recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene, and splices one V segment to one J segment.
During RNA processing, all but one V and J segment are spliced out. Recombination and splicing may result in over 106possible
VJ combinations. As a result, each differentiated B cell in the human body typically has a unique variable chain. The constant
domain, which does not bind antibody, is the same for all antibodies.

different functions.
After an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood. BCRs on naïve B
cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class. IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies. Prior to
antibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies) linked by a joining (J)
chain, as shown inFigure 42.23. The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens.
However, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs, which are
one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon reexposure to the same pathogen.Figure 42.23
summarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures.
Figure42.23Immunoglobulins have different functions, but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a Y-shaped structure.
IgAs populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts.
Collectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans). The total number of IgA
molecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG molecules in the blood serum. A small amount of IgA is
also secreted into the serum in monomeric form. Conversely, some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of the mucosa. Similar to
IgM, IgA molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a J chain. However, IgAs are secreted mostly as dimeric
molecules, not pentamers.
IgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator. IgD is also present in
small quantities. Similar to IgM, BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of naïve B cells. This class supports antigen
recognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells.
Antibody Functions
Differentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly
significant against extracellular pathogens and toxins. Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells.
Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease. For instance, a
person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a
nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor’s blood serum. This phenomenon is
calledpassive immunity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to
infections during the first few months of life.
Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated inFigure 42.24, by blocking key sites on the pathogen
that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that “dock” pathogens on host cells). Antibody neutralization can prevent
pathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are already
infected to prevent progression of an established infection. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by
the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.

• Antibodies 1217
Figure42.25(a) Affinity refers to the strength of single interaction between antigen and antibody, while avidity refers to the strength of all
interactions combined. (b) An antibody may cross react with different epitopes.
The termaviditydescribes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as IgM and IgA).
Although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the
antibodies in a multimeric structure. The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being
detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric IgM, are classified
as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. Essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind
many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction.
Antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on
different antigens. Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino acids), it is
possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions.Cross
reactivitydescribes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but to a different
antigen.
Cross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been
exposed to or vaccinated against one of them. For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface
structures of various Gram-negative bacteria. Conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that
resemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage. Patients who develop
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA. These antibodies may have
been initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens. This phenomenon is
also called molecular mimicry.

Disruptions in the Immune System
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe hypersensitivity
• Define autoimmunity
A functioning immune system is essential for survival, but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the
mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step. In the competition between immune
protection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation
time and other characteristics. For instance,Streptococcus pneumoniae(bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis)
surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune
system.Staphylococcus aureus(bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called
leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system.
HIV infects T cells via their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of T cells in the body; this inhibits the
H H
adaptive immune system’s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. As a result, HIV-infected individuals
often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause
devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals. Maladaptive responses of immune cells and molecules themselves can
also disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system, leading to host cell damage that could become fatal.
Immunodeficiency
Failures, insufficiencies, or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and
replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed.Immunodeficiencyis the failure,
insufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited. Immunodeficiency can be
acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical
treatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of
lymphocytes and elevate an individual’s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Dozens of genetic disorders result in
immunodeficiencies, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte syndrome, and MHC II
deficiencies. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur. Neutropenia is one form in which the
immune system produces a below-average number of neutrophils, the body’s most abundant phagocytes. As a result, bacterial
infections may go unrestricted in the blood, causing serious complications.
Hypersensitivities
Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are
termedhypersensitivities. The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. A large proportion of
the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.
Allergies
The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs
within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called anallergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits
symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon initial exposure to a
potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting
processed antigen to T cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response
H
to parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This
process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE molecules on mast cells bind the
antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin;
these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses.Figure 42.26shows an example of an
allergic response to ragweed pollen. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery
eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives, airway contraction with severe

respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure. This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock. If not treated with
epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this condition can be fatal.
Figure42.26On first exposure to an allergen, an IgE antibody is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a harmless antigen. The IgE
molecules bind to mast cells, and on secondary exposure, the mast cells release histamines and other modulators that affect the
symptoms of allergy. (credit: modification of work by NIH)
Delayed hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after secondary exposure
for a maximal reaction to be observed. This type of hypersensitivity involves the T 1 cytokine-mediated inflammatory response
H
and may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis (rash or skin irritation). Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some
individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics. Delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune
response to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on
individuals who were previously exposed toMycobacterium tuberculosis. That is also why cortisone is used to treat such
responses: it will inhibit cytokine production.
Autoimmunity
Autoimmunityis a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population. Most types
of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response. Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are
termedautoantibodies. In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, muscle cell receptors that induce
contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies. The result is muscle weakness that may include marked
difficultly with fine and/or gross motor functions. In systemic lupus erythematosus, a diffuse autoantibody response to the
individual’s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases. As illustrated inFigure 42.27, systemic lupus
erythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue damage
via antibody binding, complement recruitment, lysis, and inflammation.

Reproduction Methods
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction
• Discuss asexual reproduction methods
• Discuss sexual reproduction methods
Animals produce offspring through asexual and/or sexual reproduction. Both methods have advantages and
disadvantages.Asexual reproductionproduces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because
the offspring are all clones of the original parent. A single individual can produce offspring asexually and
large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly. In a stable or predictable environment, asexual
reproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that
environment. In an unstable or unpredictable environment asexually-reproducing species may be at a
disadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to
survive in new or different conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow
for a speedy response to environmental changes if individuals have mutations. An additional advantage of
asexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats may be easier when an individual does not need to
find a mate to reproduce.
Duringsexual reproductionthe genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically
diverse offspring that differ from their parents. The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is
thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment. Species
that reproduce sexually must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females, which can
limit the ability to colonize new habitats as both sexes must be present.
Asexual Reproduction
Asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled
and multi-celled organisms. There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually.
Fission
Fission, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-
celled organisms. After a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. Some
unicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis. In other organisms, part of the
individual separates and forms a second individual. This process occurs, for example, in many asteroid
echinoderms through splitting of the central disk. Some sea anemones and some coral polyps (Figure 43.2)
also reproduce through fission.

leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals. Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate
animals such as corals and hydras. In hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as
illustrated inFigure 43.3, whereas in coral budding, the bud does not detach and multiplies as part of a new colony.
Figure43.3Hydra reproduce asexually through budding.

Fragmentation
Fragmentationis the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration. If the animal is capable of
fragmentation, and the part is big enough, a separate individual will regrow.
For example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation.Figure 43.4illustrates a sea star for
which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the
sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately for the
workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams.
Fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans.
Figure43.4Sea stars can reproduce through fragmentation. The large arm, a fragment from another sea star, is developing into a new
individual.
Note that in fragmentation, there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals, whereas in fission, two
individuals of approximate size are formed.

Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is female
first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, its termed protandry or “first male.” Oysters, for example, are
born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.

Fertilization
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss internal and external methods of fertilization
• Describe the methods used by animals for development of offspring during gestation
• Describe the anatomical adaptions that occurred in animals to facilitate reproduction
Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either
inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female. Humans provide an example of the
former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter.
External Fertilization
External fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water. After the
sperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place. Most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning where one
or several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time. The release of the
reproductive material may be triggered by water temperature or the length of daylight. Nearly all fish spawn, as do crustaceans
(such as crabs and shrimp), mollusks (such as oysters), squid, and echinoderms (such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers).Figure
43.6shows salmon spawning in a shallow stream. Frogs, like those shown inFigure 43.7, corals, molluscs, and sea cucumbers
also spawn.

undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity. When the coelom becomes filled, the cells are released
through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open. Reproductive organs evolved with the development of gonads that
produce sperm and eggs. These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number of chromosomes
in each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.
Complete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. Sperm are made in testes and then travel
through coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. Eggs mature in the ovary. When they are released from the ovary, they travel
to the uterine tubes for fertilization. Some insects have a specialized sac, called aspermatheca, which stores sperm for later use,
sometimes up to a year. Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival.
Vertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences. Non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body
opening, called acloaca, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. Coupling between birds usually involves
positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm. Mammals have separate openings for the systems in
the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring. The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large numbers
of offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus.
Sperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery environment
for external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into the female’s
vagina in mammals.

Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe human male and female reproductive anatomies
• Discuss the human sexual response
• Describe spermatogenesis and oogenesis and discuss their differences and similarities
As animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the organism.
The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the
growth and development of offspring.
Human Reproductive Anatomy
The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarlyin uterountil a low level of the hormone testosterone is
released from male gonads. Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs. When
testosterone is absent, the tissues develop into female sexual tissues. Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. Tissues that
produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a
female; that is, they are homologous structures.
Male Reproductive Anatomy
In the male reproductive system, thescrotumhouses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for
blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. Thetestesare a pair of male reproductive organs that produce
sperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in.) in size and divided into wedge-
shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.
Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated inFigure 43.8
so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the
body at about 2°C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. Infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes
do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development.

The bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. These are the seminal
vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated inFigure 43.8. Theseminal vesiclesare a
pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. The glands make a solution that is thick, yellowish, and
alkaline. As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal
environment. The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic
acid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen.
Thepenis, illustrated inFigure 43.8, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ
during intercourse. The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. These consist of a

the renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. An orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory
organs connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation. After
intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.
The walnut-shapedprostate glandsurrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. It has a series of short ducts
that directly connect to the urethra. The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. The muscle provides much of
the force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient),
enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes
after release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.
Thebulbourethral gland, or Cowper’s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It neutralizes any
acid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may
contain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm
are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions. The location and functions of the male reproductive organs are summarized
inTable 43.1.

The breasts consist of mammary glands and fat. The size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat deposited behind the
gland. Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with
nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.
Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, theuterus, and the vagina, shown inFigure 43.10. The pair of
ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex: the medulla
contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste. The outer layers of cells of the cortex are
the functional parts of the ovaries. The cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that develop during fetal
developmentin utero. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares the eggs for release. At
ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated inFigure 43.11a.
Figure43.11Oocytes develop in (a) follicles, located in the ovary. At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, the follicle matures. At ovulation,
the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg. The follicle becomes a corpus luteum, which eventually degenerates. The (b) follicle in this light

Theoviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact
with the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-like
projections called fimbriae, illustrated inFigure 43.10b. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the nonmotile
egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth

Spermatogenesis
Figure43.12During spermatogenesis, four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte.
Spermatogenesis, illustrated inFigure 43.12, occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules (Figure 43.8), with stem cells at the
periphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube. Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid,
undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with one
offspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm.
Meiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte. At the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced called
a secondary spermatocyte. This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division. The cell produced at the end of
meiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a sperm cell. Four
sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.
Stem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive state.
During adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the production of
viable sperm. This continues into old age.

Oogenesis
Oogenesis, illustrated inFigure 43.13, occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries. As with sperm production, oogenesis starts
with a germ cell, called an oogonium (plural: oogonia), but this cell undergoes mitosis to increase in number, eventually
resulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo.

Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the roles of male and female reproductive hormones
• Discuss the interplay of the ovarian and menstrual cycles
• Describe the process of menopause
The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the hypothalamus and
anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes
the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release offollicle stimulating hormone
(FSH)andluteinizing hormone (LH)from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Note that the body must reach puberty in order
for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced. Although FSH and LH are named after
their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction.
Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.
Male Hormones
At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time. FSH enters

the testes and stimulates theSertoli cellsto begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated inFigure
43.14. LH also enters the testes and stimulates theinterstitial cells of Leydigto make and release testosterone into the testes and
the blood.
Testosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence,
stimulates spermatogenesis. These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary,
and pubic hair, and the beginnings of the sex drive.
Figure43.14Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.
A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior
pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH. The Sertoli cells produce the hormoneinhibin, which is released into the
blood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow
down. If the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.
Female Hormones
The control of reproduction in females is more complex. As with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release of
the hormones FSH and LH. In addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles.Estrogenis the
reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also responsible
for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period
necessary for bone maturation.Progesteroneassists in endometrial regrowth and inhibition of FSH and LH release.
In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells produce
the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and
stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that
prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and
progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.
The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle
Theovarian cyclegoverns the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while themenstrual cyclegoverns the
preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining. These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle,
with an average length of 28 days.
The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown inFigure 43.15. Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH cause the
growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin
releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy. The
trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells. If
pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual
cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated
during the end of the last cycle.

Following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated inFigure 43.15and the menstrual cycle enters its
secretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured
follicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum
produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of
further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of
FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of estrogen
produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.
If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone
decrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The
decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and
starting the cycles again.Figure 43.17visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone
levels.

CAREER CONNECTION
Reproductive Endocrinologist
A reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to reproduction and infertility
in both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems, infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and
menopause. Doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves
the use of procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such asin vitrofertilization.
Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics and gynecology,
then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board certified in this area, the physician must pass written
and oral exams in both areas.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain fetal development during the three trimesters of gestation
• Describe labor and delivery
• Compare the efficacy and duration of various types of contraception
• Discuss causes of infertility and the therapeutic options available
Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. The length of time of
gestationvaries among animals, but is very similar among the great apes: human gestation is 266 days, while chimpanzee
gestation is 237 days, a gorilla’s is 257 days, and orangutan gestation is 260 days long. The fox has a 57-day gestation. Dogs and
cats have similar gestations averaging 60 days. The longest gestation for a land mammal is an African elephant at 640 days. The
longest gestations among marine mammals are the beluga and sperm whales at 460 days.
Human Gestation
Twenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte. When fertilized (at
conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18). The
developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of
the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium
closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone calledhuman
beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG)which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures
adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo.
Pregnancy tests determine the level ofβ-HCG in urine or serum. If the hormone is present, the test is positive.

Contraception and Birth Control
The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control. Strictly speaking,contraceptionrefers to
preventing the sperm and egg from joining. Both terms are, however, frequently used interchangeably.
Contraceptive Methods
Failure Rate in Typical Use Over 12
Method Examples
Months

Barrier 15 to 24%
spermicides
oral, patch, vaginal ring 8%
Hormonal injection 3%
implant less than 1%
natural family planning 12 to 25%
Other withdrawal 27%
sterilization less than 1%
Table43.3
Table 43.3lists common methods of contraception. The failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but the
typical rates that occur. A failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the method’s use over a twelve-month period.
Barrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing
fertilization. Spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm. Sponges, which are saturated with
spermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening. Combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods
achieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately.
Nearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the
method. Natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times
when the egg is not available. A woman’s body temperature may rise a degree Celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus may
increase in volume and become more pliable. These changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or less likely
to result in fertilization. Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before ejaculation
occurs. This is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral gland’s
secretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis.
Hormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from
releasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. The method of administering the hormone
affects failure rate. The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the hormone under
the skin. The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of tubal ligation in the
woman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an inflammatory condition
that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.
Compliance with the contraceptive method is a strong contributor to the success or failure rate of any particular method. The
only method that is completely effective at preventing conception is abstinence. The choice of contraceptive method depends on
the goals of the woman or couple. Tubal ligation and vasectomy are considered permanent prevention, while other methods are

Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss how fertilization occurs
• Explain how the embryo forms from the zygote
• Discuss the role of cleavage and gastrulation in animal development
The process in which an organism develops from a single-celled zygote to a multi-cellular organism is complex and well-
regulated. The early stages of embryonic development are also crucial for ensuring the fitness of the organism.
Fertilization
Fertilization, pictured inFigure 43.23a is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote. The egg and
sperm each contain one set of chromosomes. To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes,

## Section 801.2
• Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development 1249
only one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of
glycoproteins called thezona pellucida. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of biochemical events, called the
acrosomal reactions, take place. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation
of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane,
as illustrated inFigure 43.23b. The fusion of these two membranes creates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is
transferred into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to
form a diploid genome.
Figure43.23(a) Fertilization is the process in which sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote. (b) Acrosomal reactions help the sperm degrade
the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allow the sperm to transfer its nucleus. (credit: (b) modification of work by Mariana Ruiz
Villareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg
membrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg. If this mechanism
fails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting inpolyspermy. The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies
within a few days.
Cleavage and Blastula Stage
The development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the
blastula. The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 43.24a). After the
cleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the
blastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). Mammals at this stage form a structure called the
blastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown inFigure 43.24b. During
cleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells.
Each cell within the blastula is called a blastomere.
Figure43.24(a) During cleavage, the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size. (b) The cells rearrange themselves
to form a hollow ball with a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity called the blastula.
Cleavage can take place in two ways:holoblastic(total) cleavage ormeroblastic(partial) cleavage. The type of cleavage depends
on the amount of yolk in the eggs. In placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the mother’s
body, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage. Other species, such as birds, with a lot of yolk
in the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage.
In mammals, the blastula forms theblastocystin the next stage of development. Here the cells in the blastula arrange
themselves in two layers: theinner cell mass, and an outer layer called thetrophoblast. The inner cell mass is also known as the
embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo. At this stage of development, illustrated inFigure 43.25the

Figure43.27This logo from the Second International Eugenics Conference in New York City in September of 1921 shows how
eugenics attempted to merge several fields of study with the goal of producing a genetically superior human race.
If you could prevent your child from getting a devastating genetic disease, would you do it? Would you select the sex of your
child or select for their attractiveness, strength, or intelligence? How far would you go to maximize the possibility of
resistance to disease? The genetic engineering of a human child, the production of "designer babies" with desirable
phenotypic characteristics, was once a topic restricted to science fiction. This is the case no longer: science fiction is now
overlapping into science fact. Many phenotypic choices for offspring are already available, with many more likely to be
possible in the not too distant future. Which traits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much
debate within the worldwide medical community. The ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon, and some
fear that modern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics.
Eugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic makeup of the human
race. The goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent (although controversial) in several countries
during the early 20thcentury, but fell into disrepute when Nazi Germany developed an extensive eugenics program in the
1930s and 40s. As part of their program, the Nazis forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the so-called "unfit" and
killed tens of thousands of institutionally disabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior
race of Germans known as Aryans. Ever since, eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed, but there are still those
who promote them.
Efforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with desired traits.
In fact, eugenicist Robert Klark Graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included samples exclusively from donors
with high IQs. The "genius" sperm bank failed to capture the public's imagination and the operation closed in 1999.
In more recent times, the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been developed. PGD involves the
screening of human embryos as part of the process ofin vitrofertilization, during which embryos are conceived and grown
outside the mother's body for some period of time before they are implanted. The term PGD usually refers to both the
diagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos.
In the least controversial use of PGD, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic diseases such as
sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing allele or pair of alleles has been
identified. By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation into the mother, the disease is prevented, and
the unused embryos are either donated to science or discarded. There are relatively few in the worldwide medical
community that question the ethics of this type of procedure, which allows individuals scared to have children because of
the alleles they carry to do so successfully. The major limitation to this procedure is its expense. Not usually covered by
medical insurance and thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such
complicated methodologies. Yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-cut, not everyone
agrees with the morality of these types of procedures. For example, to those who take the position that human life begins at

Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the process of organogenesis
• Identify the anatomical axes formed in vertebrates
Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise, during further development, to the different organs
in the animal body. This process is calledorganogenesis. Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the
cells within the embryo.
Organogenesis
Organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells
express specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express
the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is
regulated by cellular signaling cascades.
Scientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (Drosophila) and the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans.
Drosophilahave segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed scientists
to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points. The
nematodeC.eleganshas roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during their
development in the nematode life cycle. There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike in
mammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.
In vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system. The ectoderm forms
epithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues. During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules called
growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. The remaining cells in the center form
the neural plate. If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural
tissue.
The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called theneural tube, as illustrated in
Figure 43.28. In further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord.

body. A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells calledsomiteswith spaces between
them. The somites illustrated inFigure 43.29will further develop into the cells that form the vertebrae and ribs, the dermis of
the dorsal skin, the skeletal muscles of the back, and the skeletal muscles of the body wall and limbs. The mesoderm also forms a
structure called the notochord, which is rod-shaped and forms the central axis of the animal body.

The Scope of Ecology
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define ecology and the four basic levels of ecological research
• Describe examples of the ways in which ecology requires the integration of different
scientific disciplines
• Distinguish between abiotic and biotic components of the environment
• Recognize the relationship between abiotic and biotic components of the environment
Ecologyis the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment. One core goal of ecology
is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment. Attainment of
this goal requires the integration of scientific disciplines inside and outside of biology, such as mathematics,
statistics, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, evolution, biodiversity, geology, and climatology.
LINK TO LEARNING
Climate change can alter where organisms live, which can sometimes directly affect human health. Watch
the PBS video“Feeling the Effects of Climate Change”(http://openstax.org/l/climate_health)in which
researchers discover a pathogenic organism living far outside of its normal range.
Levels of Ecological Study
When a discipline such as biology is studied, it is often helpful to subdivide it into smaller, related areas. For
instance, cell biologists interested in cell signaling need to understand the chemistry of the signal molecules
(which are usually proteins) as well as the result of cell signaling. Ecologists interested in the factors that
influence the survival of an endangered species might use mathematical models to predict how current
conservation efforts affect endangered organisms.
To produce a sound set of management options, aconservation biologistneeds to collect accurate data,
including current population size, factors affecting reproduction (like physiology and behavior), habitat
requirements (such as plants and soils), and potential human influences on the endangered population and
its habitat (which might be derived through studies in sociology and urban ecology). Within the discipline of
ecology, researchers work at four general levels, which sometimes overlap. These levels are organism,
population, community, and ecosystem (Figure 44.2).

Organismal Ecology
Researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in specific
habitats. These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. For instance, the Karner blue butterfly
(Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Figure 44.3) is considered a specialist because the females onlyoviposit(that is, lay eggs) on wild
lupine (Lupinus perennis). This specific requirement and adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is completely
dependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its survival.
Figure44.3The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas with few trees or shrubs,
such as pine barrens and oak savannas. It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants. (credit: modification of work by J & K Hollingsworth,
USFWS)
After hatching, the (first instar) caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine (Figure 44.4). The
caterpillars pupate as a chrysalis to undergo the final stage of metamorphosis and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks.
The adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species, such as milkweeds. Generally there are
two broods of the Karner blue each year.
A researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about
egg laying requirements, ask questions about the butterflies’ preferred thoracic flight temperature (a physiological question), or
the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages (a behavioral question).

vary over the range of the butterfly.
Ecosystem Ecology
Ecosystem ecologyis an extension of organismal, population, and community ecology. The ecosystem is composed of all the
bioticcomponents (living things) in an area along with theabioticcomponents (nonliving things) of that area. Some of the
abiotic components include air, water, and soil. Ecosystem biologists ask questions about how nutrients and energy are stored
and how they move among organisms and through the surrounding atmosphere, soil, and water.
The Karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oak-pine barren habitat. This habitat is characterized by natural
disturbance and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen. The availability of nutrients is an important factor in the
distribution of the plants that live in this habitat. Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could ask questions about the
importance of limited resources and the movement of resources, such as nutrients, though the biotic and abiotic portions of the
ecosystem.
CAREER CONNECTION
Ecologist
A career in ecology contributes to many facets of human society. Understanding ecological issues can help society meet the basic
human needs of food, shelter, and health care. Ecologists can conduct their research in the laboratory and outside in natural
environments (Figure 44.5). These natural environments can be as close to home as the stream running through your campus or
as far away as the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Ecologists manage natural resources such as white-
tailed deer populations (Odocoileus virginianus) for hunting or aspen (Populusspp.) timber stands for paper production.
Ecologists also work as educators who teach children and adults at various institutions including universities, high schools,
museums, and nature centers. Ecologists may also work in advisory positions assisting local, state, and federal policymakers to
develop laws that are ecologically sound, or they may develop those policies and legislation themselves. To become an ecologist
requires at least an undergraduate degree, usually in a natural science. The undergraduate degree is often followed by
specialized training or an advanced degree, depending on the area of ecology selected. Ecologists should also have a broad
background in the physical sciences, as well as a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics.

## Section 813.1
Biogeography
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define biogeography
• List and describe abiotic factors that affect the global distribution of plant and animal species
• Compare the impact of abiotic forces on aquatic and terrestrial environments
• Summarize the effects of abiotic factors on net primary productivity
Many forces influence the communities of living organisms present in different parts of thebiosphere(all of the parts of Earth
inhabited by life). The biosphere extends into the atmosphere (several kilometers above Earth) and into the depths of the oceans.
Despite its apparent vastness to an individual human, the biosphere occupies only a minute space when compared to the known
universe. Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere.
The abiotic factors influence the distribution ofbiomes: large areas of land with similar climate, flora, and fauna.
Biogeography
Biogeographyis the study of the geographic distribution of living things and theabiotic factors that affect their distribution.
Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation. As these abiotic factors change, the
composition of plant and animal communities also changes. For example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator and walk
north, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities. At the beginning of your journey, you would see tropical wet
forests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator. As you
continued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with
scattered trees. You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture. At about 30 degrees north, these forests
would give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation and high insolation (sunlight).
Moving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies. Eventually, grasslands are replaced by
deciduous temperate forests. These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests and taiga found in the subarctic, the area
south of the Arctic Circle. Finally, you would reach the Arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes. This trek
north reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated
with ecosystems found at different latitudes. However, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic
factors such as jet streams, the Gulf Stream, and ocean currents. If you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would see
in the vegetation would parallel in many ways those as you move to higher latitudes.
Ecologists who study biogeography examine patterns ofspecies distribution. No species exists everywhere; for example, the
Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina. Anendemic speciesis one which is
naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size. Other species are generalists: species which
live in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon (Procyonspp) for example, is native to most of North and Central America.
Species distribution patternsare based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time
required for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary
thinking in the eighteenth century. Some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur in regions that have
been physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers. Biologists estimate that Australia, for example, has
between 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals. Approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are
endemic species found solely in Australia (Figure 44.6ab).

Sometimes ecologists discover unique patterns of species distribution by determining where species arenotfound. Despite
being tropical, Hawaii, for example, has no native land species of reptiles or amphibians, only a few native species of butterflies,
and only one native terrestrial mammal, the hoary bat. Most of New Guinea, as another example, lacks placental mammals.

Like animals, plants can be endemic or generalists: endemic plants are found only on specific regions of the Earth, while
generalists are found on many regions. Isolated land masses—such as Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar—often have large
numbers of endemic plant species. Some of these plants are endangered due to human activity. The forest gardenia (Gardenia
brighamii), for instance, is endemic to Hawaii; only an estimated 15–20 trees are thought to exist (Figure 44.7).

Hawaiian Islands in small populations consisting of a few individual specimens. (credit: Forest & Kim Starr)
Energy Sources
Energy from the sun is captured by green plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic protists. These organisms convert
solar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things. Light availability can be an important force directly affecting
the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers. For instance, plants in the understory of a temperate forest are shaded when

• Biogeography 1269
Figure44.9Ocean upwelling is an important process that recycles nutrients and energy in the ocean. As wind (green arrows) pushes
offshore, it causes water from the ocean bottom (red arrows) to move to the surface, bringing up nutrients from the ocean depths.
In freshwater systems, such as lakes, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature and wind changes. The
nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fall turnover. Thespring-and-fall turnoverare
seasonal processes that recycle nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater lake to the top of the lake (Figure 44.10).
These turnovers are caused by the formation of athermocline: layers of water with temperatures that are significantly different
from those above and below it.
In wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. However, the water under the ice is slightly
warmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 °C to 5 °C (39.2 °F to 41 °F). Water is densest at about 4 °C;
therefore, the deepest water is also the densest. The deepest water is oxygen-poor because the decomposition of organic
material at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot be replaced by means of oxygen diffusion into the surface
of the water, due to the surface ice layer.
VISUAL CONNECTION
Figure44.10The spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move the nutrients and oxygen at the
bottom of deep lakes to the top. Turnover occurs because water has a maximum density at 4 °C. Surface water temperature changes as the
seasons progress, and denser water sinks.

# Chapter 815

## Section 815.1
• Biogeography 1271
• Marine organisms are surrounded by water with a higher solute concentration than the organism and, thus, are in danger
of losing water to the environment because of osmosis. These organisms have morphological and physiological adaptations
to retain water and release solutes into the environment. For example, Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), sneeze
out water vapor that is high in salt in order to maintain solute concentrations within an acceptable range while swimming
in the ocean and eating marine plants.
Inorganic Nutrients and Soil
Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in determining the distribution and the abundance of
living things. Plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots.
Therefore, soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content together all play an important role
in the distribution of plants. Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume. Therefore, animal distributions
are related to the distribution of what they eat. In some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the
environment.
Other Aquatic Factors
Some abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments. Terrestrial
animals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe. Oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms living at very high elevations,
however, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air. In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved oxygen is
related to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer
water. In addition, salinity, currents, and tidal changes can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.
Other Terrestrial Factors
Wind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation, transpiration, and convective heat loss
from the surface of all organisms. The physical force of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic
factors, as well as an ecosystem’s organisms.
Fire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. Some organisms are
adapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. For example, the jack
pine (Pinus banksiana) requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open (Figure 44.11). Through the burning of pine needles, fire
adds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth.
Figure44.11The mature cones of the jack pine(Pinus banksiana)open only when exposed to high temperatures, such as during a forest
fire. A fire is likely to kill most vegetation, so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely to receive ample sunlight than one that
germinates under normal conditions. (credit: USDA)
Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth
Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic
matter available as food (net primary productivity).Net primary productivityis an estimation of all of the organic matter
available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular
respiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring theabove-ground biomassper
unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots (whose mass is very difficult to measure). This means that a
large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is
an important variable when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground

## Section 816.1
Terrestrial Biomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify the two major abiotic factors that determine terrestrial biomes
• Recognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes
The Earth’s biomes are categorized into two major groups:terrestrialandaquatic.Terrestrial biomesare based on land, while
aquatic biomesinclude both ocean and freshwater biomes. The eight major terrestrial biomes on Earth are each distinguished
by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation. Comparing the annual totals of precipitation and fluctuations in
precipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the importance of abiotic factors in the distribution of biomes.
Temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of the biome
and the vegetation type in the biome. The distribution of these biomes shows that the same biome can occur in geographically
distinct areas with similar climates (Figure 44.12).

## Section 816.2
• Terrestrial Biomes 1273
deciduous forests, the trees in this biome do not have a seasonal loss of leaves associated with variations in temperature and
sunlight; these forests are “evergreen” year-round.
The temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes,
with the temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 34 °C (68 °F to 93 °F). When one compares the annual temperature variation of
tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest
becomes apparent. This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and fall)
growth seen in other more temperate biomes. In contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and
short days during the yearly cycle. Instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (11–12 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation,
thereby, a longer period of time for plant growth.
The annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 cm to 660 cm (50–200 in) with some monthly variation. While
sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable. Tropical wet forests typically have wet
months in which there can be more than 30 cm (11–12 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10
cm (3.5 in) of rainfall. However, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds theannualrainfall of some other biomes,
such as deserts.
Tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas
are ideal for plant growth. Therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with
very high species diversities (Figure 44.13). Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome; on average
between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of South American Amazonian rain forest. One
way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome. On the forest floor is a
sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage. A layer of trees rises above
this understory and is topped by a closed uppercanopy—the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves. Some additional
trees emerge through this closed upper canopy. These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants,
fungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests.
For example,epiphytesare plants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed. Epiphytes are found throughout
tropical wet forest biomes. Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet
forests for food and shelter. Some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle.
Figure44.13Tropical wet forests, such as these forests along the Madre de Dios river, Peru, near the Amazon River, have high species
diversity. (credit: Roosevelt Garcia)
Savannas
Savannasare grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in Africa, South America, and northern Australia (Figure
44.12). Savannas are usually hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 °C to 29 °C (75 °F to 84 °F) and an annual
rainfall of 10–40 cm (3.9–15.7 in). Savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as well as they
do in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes). As a result, within the grasses andforbs(herbaceous flowering plants) that
dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (Figure 44.14). Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome,
plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly resprout after a fire.

Figure44.15To reduce water loss, many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all. The leaves of ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens),
shown here in the Sonora Desert near Gila Bend, Arizona, appear only after rainfall, and then are shed.
Chaparral
The chaparralis also called the scrub forest and is found in California, along the Mediterranean Sea, and along the southern
coast of Australia (Figure 44.12). The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm (25.6–29.5 in), and the majority of
the rain falls in the winter. Summers are very dry and many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime. The
chaparral vegetation, shown inFigure 44.16, is dominated by shrubs adapted to periodic fires, with some plants producing seeds
that only germinate after a hot fire. The ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that fertilize the soil and
promote plant regrowth.

Figure44.18Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in the temperate forest. (credit: Oliver Herold)
The trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical wet
forests because most trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests. The soils of the
temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients. This is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors, which
does not develop in tropical rainforests. As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects
soil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly,Armadillidium
vulgare) and their predators, such as the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus).
Boreal Forests
Theboreal forest, also known astaigaor coniferous forest, is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada,
Alaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 44.12). This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The annual
precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7–39 in) and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs because of the
cold temperatures.
The long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing (coniferous) plants.
These are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. Evergreen
trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a
needle-like leaf than a broad leaf. This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest. In
addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and
deciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that retain
nitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.
The net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. The above-ground
biomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long-lived and accumulate a large standing
biomass over time. Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests. Boreal forests lack
the pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests. The structure of a boreal forest is often only
a tree layer and a ground layer (Figure 44.19). When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more slowly than broad leaves;
therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth.

physical and chemical properties than air, however. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are
no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. As one descends into a deep body of water, there will eventually be a
depth which the sunlight cannot reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might
obscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features of the environment. The importance of
light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. In
freshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the
energy aspects of light. The thermal properties of water (rates of heating and cooling and the ability to store much larger
amounts of energy than the air) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and
weather patterns. Marine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less
important in most freshwater lakes.
The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones (Figure 44.21). All of the ocean’s open water is referred to as thepelagic realm
(or zone). Thebenthic realm(or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor.
Within the pelagic realm is thephotic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate (approximately 200 m or
650 ft). At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as theaphotic zone. The majority of the
ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep (in the Mariana
Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To give some perspective on the depth of
this trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep. These realms and zones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well.

bacteria exist.
The deepest part of the ocean is theabyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. The abyssal zone (Figure 44.21) is very
cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. There are a variety of invertebrates and fishes
found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light. Hydrothermal vents are found
primarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from the vents.
These chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found in the
abyssal zone.
Coral Reefs
Coral reefsareocean ridgesformed by marine invertebrates, comprising mostly cnidarians and molluscs, living in warm
shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean. They are found within 30˚ north and south of the equator. TheGreat Barrier
Reefis perhaps the best-known and largest reef system in the world—visible from the International Space Station! This massive
and ancient reef is located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reef systems are fringing islands,
which are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now
underwater. The coral organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium
carbonate skeleton. These calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef (Figure 44.23). Corals found
in shallower waters (at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic
unicellular algae. The relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters in
which these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow.
Some corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae; these corals attain energy and
nutrients using stinging cells called cnidocytes on their tentacles to capture prey.

(invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated with
the coral. In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators, herbivores, and
planktivores, which consume planktonic organisms such as bacteria, archaea, algae, and protists floating in the pelagic zone.

Lakes and Ponds
Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important
abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, as we have seen, thermal stratification of lakes
and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can
penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond.Phytoplankton(algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out
photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds.Zooplankton, such as rotifers and larvae and adult
crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead
organisms that sink to the bottom.
Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are the determining factors
in the amount of phytoplankton growth that takes place in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and
phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in
a large accumulation of algae called analgal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light
penetration in water. They may also release toxic byproducts into the water, contaminating any drinking water taken from that
source. In addition, the lake or pond becomes aphotic, and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and
decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to
die, resulting in a dead zone. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus
control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.

Rivers and Streams
Rivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source, orheadwater, to
a lake or ocean. The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon River in South America, and the Mississippi River
in North America.
Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a point of origin referred to
assource water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. Thechannel(the width of the river or stream) is
narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Because of this, the current is often faster here than at
any other point of the river or stream.
The fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is usually
clear and free of debris. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits
the growth of phytoplankton. An additional input of energy can come from leaves and other organic material that fall
downstream into the river or stream, as well as from trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose,
the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving
water. For instance, leeches (phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on the anterior and ventral areas of the body.
These suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place, and are also used to attach to their prey. Freshwater
trout species (phylum Chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and streams.
As the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows. This slow-
moving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation.

Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define global climate change
• Summarize the effects of the Industrial Revolution on global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
• Describe three natural factors affecting long-term global climate
• List two or more greenhouse gases and describe their role in the greenhouse effect
All biomes areuniversally affectedby global conditions, such as climate, that ultimately shape each biome’s environment.
Scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the
last sixty years.Global climate changeis the term used to describe altered global weather patterns, especially a worldwide
increase in temperature and resulting changes in the climate, due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Climate and Weather
A common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular region (for
example, a very cool week in June in central Indiana) provides evidence of global climate change. However, a cold week in June is
a weather-related event and not a climate-related one. These misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms
climateandweather.

• Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change 1285
Climaterefers to the long-term,predictable atmospheric conditionsof a specific area. The climate of a biome is characterized
by having consistent seasonal temperature and rainfall ranges. Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one
particular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. In contrast,weatherrefers to the
conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles. Long-range
weather forecasts are available but can be unreliable.
To better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern
Wisconsin. You would be thinking aboutclimatewhen you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because you
have long-term knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August would be a better choice for an outdoor event
in Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January. However, you cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held
on because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day. Climate can be considered “average” weather that
takes place over many years.
Global Climate Change
Climate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study:
• evidence of current and past global climate change
• drivers of global climate change
• documented results of climate change
It is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media reports about
global climate change. We should note that it is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the
data showing that Earth’s climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change.
Evidence for Global Climate Change
Since scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation,
they must instead indirectly measure temperature. To do this, scientists rely onhistorical evidence of Earth’s past climate.
Antarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence for climate change. These ice cores are samples ofpolar iceobtained by
means of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers. Viewing the ice cores is like traveling
backwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period. Trapped within the ice are air bubbles and other
biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data. Antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to
indirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the past 400,000 years (Figure 44.26a). The 0 °C on this graph refers to the
long-term average. Temperatures that are greater than 0 °C exceed Earth’s long-term average temperature. Conversely,
temperatures that are less than 0 °C are less than Earth’s average temperature. This figure shows that there have been periodic
cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature.

Figure44.27Ice at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica was laid down over the course of 420,000 years and reached a depth of
over 3,000 m. By measuring the amount of CO2trapped in the ice, scientists have determined past atmospheric CO2concentrations.
Temperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount ofdeuterium(a nonradioactive isotope of hydrogen) present.
Figure 44.27a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth’s temperature during the
last 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past. Two significant temperature
anomalies, orirregularities, have occurred in the last 2,000 years. These are theMedieval Climate Anomaly(or the Medieval
Warm Period) and theLittle Ice Age. A third temperature anomaly aligns with theIndustrial Era. The Medieval Climate Anomaly
occurred between 900 and 1300 AD. During this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather
conditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 °C and 0.20
°C above the norm. Although 0.10 °C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free seas of ice.
Because of this warming, the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland.
TheLittle Ice Agewas a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD. During this time, a slight cooling of a little less
than 1 °C was observed in North America, Europe, and possibly other areas of the Earth. This 1 °C change in global temperature
is a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly); however, it also resulted
in noticeable climatic changes. Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost.
TheIndustrial Revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society. Advances in
agriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States. New
technologies were invented that provided jobs and cheaper goods. These new technologies were powered using fossil fuels,
especially coal. The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the Industrial Era.
When a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide is released. With the beginning of the Industrial Era, atmospheric carbon dioxide
began to rise (Figure 44.28).

not be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect.
Scientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns. The atmospheric carbon
dioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and a
high of 300 ppm. Scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to increase
from its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration. However, beginning only a few centuries ago,
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm. The current increases
in atmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quickly—in a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years.
What is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide? A key factor that must
be recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence and industrial activities of modern
human society; no other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levelsat this rate or to this
magnitude.
Human activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in
several ways. The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and
natural gas (Figure 44.29). Deforestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of
forests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide. Methane (CH ) is produced when bacteria break down organic
4
matter under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in
rice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores. Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition of
animal and plant material that occurs in landfills. Another source of methane is the melting ofclathrates.Clathratesare frozen
chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean. When water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is
released. As the ocean’s water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more
methane. This leads to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming. This
is an example of the positive feedback loop that is leading to the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures.

Scientists have geological evidence of the consequences of long-ago climate change. Modern-day phenomena such as retreating
glaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level. Meanwhile, changes in climate can negatively affect organisms.

Population Demography
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how ecologists measure population size and density
• Describe three different patterns of population distribution
• Use life tables to calculate mortality rates
• Describe the three types of survivorship curves and relate them to specific populations
Populations are dynamic entities. Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and
populations fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural
disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within
species. The statistical study of population dynamics,demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to
investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments. Many of these
tools were originally designed to study human populations. For example,life tables, which detail the life
expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set
insurance rates. In fact, while the term “demographics” is commonly used when discussing humans, all
living populations can be studied using this approach.
Population Size and Density
The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species
exist, and how closely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be
characterized by itspopulation size (N), the total number of individuals, and itspopulation density, the
number of individuals within a specific area or volume. Population size and density are the two main
characteristics used to describe and understand populations. For example, populations with more
individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their
potential to adapt to the environment. Alternatively, a member of a population with low population density
(more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a
population of higher density. As is shown inFigure 45.2, smaller organisms tend to be more densely
distributed than larger organisms.

is the case?
Population Research Methods
The most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat. However, this
method is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually study
populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a
whole. A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density. For immobile organisms
such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, aquadratmay be used (Figure 45.3). A quadrat is a way of marking
off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal
square placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their
boundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations to estimate the
population size and density within the entire habitat. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of
organisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism. For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2
quadrat might be used. With giant redwoods, on the other hand, a larger quadrat of 100 m2might be employed. This ensures
that enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not
sampled.
Figure45.3A scientist uses a quadrat to measure population size and density. (credit: NPS Sonoran Desert Network)
For mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, scientists use a technique calledmark and recapture. This method
involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then
releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population. Later, researchers collect a new
sample, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked (Figure 45.4).
Figure45.4Mark and recapture is used to measure the population size of mobile animals such as (a) bighorn sheep, (b) the California
condor, and (c) salmon. (credit a: modification of work by Neal Herbert, NPS; credit b: modification of work by Pacific Southwest Region
USFWS; credit c: modification of work by Ingrid Taylar)
Using the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. From this,
calculations are used to estimate the total population size. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the
percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals. For example,

• Population Demography 1299
study the dynamics of a population. Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death
rates, and life expectancies. Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics
described above. For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive
individuals are present. In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition,
disease, and the accumulation of waste. Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more
potential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio (the ratio
of males to females) orage structure(the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of many
individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.
In addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time. If
birth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. However, the population size will increase if birth rates exceed
death rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. Life expectancy is another important factor; the
length of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health of the
population. These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.
Life Tables
Life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. Life tables divide the population into age
groups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. They are modeled after actuarial tables used
by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying
before their next birthday (i.e., theirmortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval,
and their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown inTable 45.1from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a
species native to northwestern North America. Notice that the population is divided into age intervals (column A). The mortality
rate (per 1000), shown in column D, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval (column B) divided by
the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C), multiplied by 1000.
For example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000 sheep.
This number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand.
As can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12
months old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors. The data indicate that if
a sheep in this population were to survive to age one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as shown by the
life expectancy numbers in column E.

Type I survivorship curve because death primarily occurs in the older years. Birds have a Type II survivorship curve, as death at any age is
equally probable. Trees have a Type III survivorship curve because very few survive the younger years, but after a certain age, individuals
are much more likely to survive.

## Section 833.2
Life Histories and Natural Selection
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how life history patterns are influenced by natural selection
• Explain different life history patterns and how different reproductive strategies affect species’ survival
A species’life historydescribes the series of events over its lifetime, such as how resources are allocated for growth,
maintenance, and reproduction. Life history traits affect the life table of an organism. A species’ life history is genetically
determined and shaped by the environment and natural selection.
Life History Patterns and Energy Budgets
Energy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is often a
major limiting factor in determining an organism’s survival. Plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via
photosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next
generation. Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food. Furthermore, some
animals must expend energy caring for their offspring. Thus, all species have anenergy budget: they must balance energy intake
with their use of energy for metabolism, reproduction, parental care, and energy storage (such as bears building up body fat for
winter hibernation).
Parental Care and Fecundity
Fecundityis the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population. In other words, fecundity describes how
many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive cycle as
soon as possible after the birth of the offspring. In animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental care given to
an individual offspring. Species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually provide little if any
care for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway). Most of their energy budget is used to
produce many tiny offspring. Animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a very early age. This is because of the energy
tradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness. Because their energy is used for producing
offspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be able to move within their
environment and find food and perhaps shelter. Even with these abilities, their small size makes them extremely vulnerable to
predation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain the species.
Animal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of their
energy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health. This is the case with many mammals, such as
humans, kangaroos, and pandas. The offspring of these species are relatively helpless at birth and need to develop before they

Energy Budgets, Reproductive Costs, and Sexual Selection inDrosophila
Research into how animals allocate their energy resources for growth, maintenance, and reproduction has used a variety of
experimental animal models. Some of this work has been done using the common fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster. Studies
have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have
already mated several times have limited sperm remaining for reproduction. Fruit flies maximize their last chances at
reproduction by selecting optimal mates.
In a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. The males that mated with
virgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number of inseminated females with which they were
unable to mate. This effect occurred regardless of how large (indicative of their age) the males were. Thus, males that did not
mate lived longer, allowing them more opportunities to find mates in the future.
More recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and how this is affected by
previous matings (Figure 45.8).2Males were allowed to select between smaller and larger females. Findings showed that larger
females had greater fecundity, producing twice as many offspring per mating as the smaller females did. Males that had
previously mated, and thus had lower supplies of sperm, were termed “resource-depleted,” while males that had not mated were
termed “non-resource-depleted.” The study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with larger
females, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. Thus, males with depleted sperm
supplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before they replenished their sperm supply, selected
larger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances for offspring. This study was one of the first to show that the
physiological state of the male affected its mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive
resources.
Figure45.8Male fruit flies that had previously mated (sperm-depleted) picked larger, more fecund females more often than those that had
not mated (non-sperm-depleted). This change in behavior causes an increase in the efficiency of a limited reproductive resource: sperm.
These studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction. First, energy expended on mating
may reduce an animal’s lifespan, but by this time they have already reproduced, so in the context of natural selection this early
death is not of much evolutionary importance. Second, when resources such as sperm (and the energy needed to replenish it)
are low, an organism’s behavior can change to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. These
changes in behavior, so important to evolution, are studied in a discipline known as behavioral biology, or ethology, at the
interface between population biology and psychology.

• Environmental Limits to Population Growth 1305
Figure45.9When resources are unlimited, populations exhibit exponential growth, resulting in a J-shaped curve. When resources are
limited, populations exhibit logistic growth. In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as resources become scarce, and it levels
off when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, resulting in an S-shaped curve.
Logistic Growth
Exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles
Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will compete (with
members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on their own
characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural
selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed thelogistic growthmodel.
Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model
In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in
environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough,
resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure 45.9). This
population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the
carrying capacity, orK.
The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The
expression “K–N” indicates how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and “K–N” divided by “K” is
the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor
to generate the logistic growth equation:
Notice that whenNis very small, (K-N)/Kbecomes close toK/Kor 1, and the right side of the equation reduces tor N, which
max
means the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity. On the other hand, whenNis large,
(K-N)/Kcomes close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped. Thus, population
growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacityK. This model also allows for the population of a negative
population growth, or a population decline. This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying
capacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative).
A graph of this equation yields anS-shaped curve(Figure 45.9), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than
exponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are
few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally,
growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.
Role of Intraspecific Competition
The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal
chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources,
whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.

Population Dynamics and Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Give examples of how the carrying capacity of a habitat may change
• Compare and contrast density-dependent growth regulation and density-independent growth regulation,
giving examples
• Give examples of exponential and logistic growth in wild animal populations
• Describe how natural selection and environmental adaptation leads to the evolution of particular life-history
patterns
The logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of real-
world population dynamics. Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not
the case. The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet. In
many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. Also, natural events such as
earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. Additionally, populations do not
usually exist in isolation. They engage ininterspecific competition: that is, they share the environment with other species
competing for the same resources. These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow.
Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. These are grouped intodensity-dependentfactors, in which the density
of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, anddensity-independentfactors, which influence mortality
in a population regardless of population density. Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on
the density of the population at onset. Conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage
populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.
Density-Dependent Regulation
Most density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition,
accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its
mortality rate. For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be
lower, reducing their population’s rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it
has more difficulty locating its food source.
An example of density-dependent regulation is shown inFigure 45.11with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal
roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), a parasite of humans and other mammals.3Denser populations of the parasite exhibited
lower fecundity: they contained fewer eggs. One possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense
populations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. This hypothesis was tested and
disproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.4The actual cause of the density-dependence of
fecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation.

change reduced the mammoth’s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago.6
It is also well documented that humans hunted these animals. A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively
responsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures.7In addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of
habitat, these scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth’s extinction was the migration of humans
across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago.
The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. It is
important to remember that humans are also part of nature. We once contributed to a species’ decline using only primitive
hunting technology.
Life Histories ofK-selected andr-selected Species
While reproductive strategies play a key role in life histories, they do not account for important factors like limited resources
and competition. The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in population
biology, that ofK-selected versusr-selected species.
The concept relates to a species’ reproductive strategies, habitat, and behavior, especially in the way that they obtain resources
and care for their young. It includes length of life and survivorship factors as well. Population biologists have grouped species
into the two large categories—K-selected andr-selected—although the categories are really two ends of a continuum.
K-selected speciesare species selected by stable, predictable environments. Populations ofK-selected species tend to exist close
to their carrying capacity (hence the termK-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. These species have few, large
offspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table 45.2). While larger in size when born,
the offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth. By the time they reach adulthood, they must develop skills to
compete for natural resources. In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes to develop or how
long it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. Examples ofK-selected species
are primates (including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (Figure 45.13a).
Oak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. As many as 50,000
acorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals such
as squirrels. In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a two- or
three-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection).
As oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage of their
energy budget to growth and maintenance. The tree’s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the competition for
sunlight, the oak’s primary energy resource. Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large, energy-rich seeds
that use their energy reserve to become quickly established (K-selection).
In contrast,r-selected specieshave a large number of small offspring (hence theirrdesignation (Table 45.2)). This strategy is
often employed in unpredictable or changing environments. Animals that arer-selected do not give long-term parental care and
the offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. Examples ofr-selected species are marine invertebrates, such as
jellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (Figure 45.13b). Dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances.
Many seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment. Seeds that land
in inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content. Note that survival is not
necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.

theory’s predictions. Furthermore, the theory ignored the age-specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know
is very important. Newdemographic-based modelsof life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many
ecological concepts included inr- andK-selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors.

## Section 838.2
Human Population Growth
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss exponential human population growth
• Explain how humans have expanded the carrying capacity of their habitat
• Relate population growth and age structure to the level of economic development in different countries
• Discuss the long-term implications of unchecked human population growth
Population dynamics can be applied to human population growth. Earth’s human population is growing rapidly, to the extent
that some worry about the ability of the earth’s environment to sustain this population. Long-term exponential growth carries
the potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death.
Although humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this
transformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earth’s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may
be in danger of collapse. The depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate change are
caused by human activities. The ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown. As some point out, it is
likely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive ones—the world’s carrying capacity for
human beings might actually decrease.
The human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below its biotic
potential (Figure 45.14). To reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine months or so during
their reproductive years. Also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support such growth. Neither of
these two conditions exists. In spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially.
Figure45.14Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential (dark blue line). Notice that while the population in Asia (yellow line),
which has many economically underdeveloped countries, is increasing exponentially, the population in Europe (light blue line), where most
of the countries are economically developed, is growing much more slowly.
A consequence of exponential human population growth is a reduction in time that it takes to add a particular number of
humans to the Earth.Figure 45.15shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only took 24 years
to add two billion people between 1975 and 1999. As already discussed, our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely
my be limited. Without new technological advances, the human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades.
However, the population will still be increasing and the threat of overpopulation remains.

Long-Term Consequences of Exponential Human Population Growth
Many dire predictions have been made about the world’s population leading to a major crisis called the “population explosion.”
In the 1968 bookThe Population Bomb, biologist Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich wrote, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s
hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing
can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.”8While many experts view this statement as incorrect based on
evidence, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot
continue indefinitely.
Several nations have instituted policies aimed at influencing population. Efforts to control population growth led to theone-
child policyin China, which is now being phased out. India also implements national and regional populations to encourage
family planning. On the other hand, Japan, Spain, Russia, Iran, and other countries have made efforts to increase population

Community Ecology
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the predator-prey cycle
• Give examples of defenses against predation and herbivory
• Describe the competitive exclusion principle
• Give examples of symbiotic relationships between species
• Describe community structure and succession
Populations rarely, if ever, live in isolation from populations of other species. In most cases, numerous species share a habitat.
The interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth and abundance. All populations
occupying the same habitat form a community: populations inhabiting a specific area at the same time. The number of species
occupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity. Areas with low diversity, such as the
glaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it
cannot be counted. Ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete
for the same resources.
Predation and Herbivory
Perhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the consumption of prey by its predator. Nature shows on
television highlight the drama of one living organism killing another. Populations of predators and prey in a community are not
constant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related. The most often cited example of predator-prey
dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old trapping data
from North American forests (Figure 45.18). This cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years, with the predator
population lagging 1–2 years behind that of the prey population. As the hare numbers increase, there is more food available for
the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. When the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill
so many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food.
When the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at least in part, to low predation pressure,
starting the cycle anew.

Figure45.18The cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare populations in Northern Ontario is an example of predator-prey dynamics.
Some researchers question the idea that predation models entirely control the population cycling of the two species. More
recent studies have pointed to undefined density-dependent factors as being important in the cycling, in addition to predation.
One possibility is that the cycling is inherent in the hare population due to density-dependent effects such as lower fecundity
(maternal stress) caused by crowding when the hare population gets too dense. The hare cycling would then induce the cycling of
the lynx because it is the lynxes’ major food source. The more we study communities, the more complexities we find, allowing
ecologists to derive more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics.
Herbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals, and it is another interspecific relationship that
affects populations. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. Some
plants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory. Other species have developed mutualistic relationships; for
example, herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that aids in plant reproduction.
Defense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory
The study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations contained
within it. Species are not static, but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural selection and other
evolutionary forces. Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory. These defenses may be
mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.
Mechanical defenses, such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles, discourage animal predation and
herbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from being able to eat the prey.
Chemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants, such as the foxglove which is extremely toxic when eaten.
Figure 45.19shows some organisms’ defenses against predation and herbivory.

caterpillar, the fire-bellied toad, and many species of beetle have bright colors that warn of a foul taste, the presence of toxic
chemicals, and/or the ability to sting or bite, respectively. Predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms will
experience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future. This type of defensive
mechanism is calledaposematic coloration, or warning coloration (Figure 45.21).
Figure45.21(a) The strawberry poison dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators that it is toxic, while the
(b) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the unpleasant odor it produces. (credit a:
modification of work by Jay Iwasaki; credit b: modification of work by Dan Dzurisin)
While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved
mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain
toxic chemicals. InBatesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one. Assuming they
share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the same level of
physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic. Many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps
or bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation (Figure 45.22).
Figure45.22Batesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species mimics the coloration of a harmful species, as is seen with the (a)
bumblebee and (b) bee-like robber fly. (credit a, b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)
InMüllerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses.Figure 45.23
shows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration. InEmsleyan/Mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey mimics a
less dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the nonvenomous milk snake. This type of mimicry is
extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types. For this type of mimicry to work, it is essential that
eating the milk snake has unpleasant but not fatal consequences. Then, these predators learn not to eat snakes with this
coloration, protecting the coral snake as well. If the snake were fatal to the predator, there would be no opportunity for the
predator to learn not to eat it, and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear.

This exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource, a different area of the habitat, or feeds
during a different time of day, called resource partitioning. The two organisms are then said to occupy different microniches.
These organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition.
Symbiosis
Symbiotic relationships, orsymbioses(plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended
period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations. Most scientists accept this
definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the
interaction. In this discussion, the broader definition will be used.
Commensalism
Acommensalrelationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither
benefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 45.25). The tree is not
harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of
the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are
unaffected. The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young would be
vulnerable to predators. Another example of a commensal relationship is the pilot fish and the shark. The pilot fish feed on the
leftovers of the host's meals, and the host is not affected in any way.

parasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat is consumed (Figure 45.27). The tapeworm can
live inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host is eating, and may grow to be over 50 ft
long by adding segments. The parasite moves from species to species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life
cycle.
Another common parasite isPlasmodium falciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the
world. Living in human liver and red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to
complete its life cycle. Thus malaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious

Characteristics of Communities
Communities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure (the types and numbers of species present) and
dynamics (how communities change over time). Understanding community structure and dynamics enables community
ecologists to manage ecosystems more effectively.
Foundation Species
Foundation speciesare considered the “base” or “bedrock” of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall structure.
They are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community. Kelp, or brown algae, is a
foundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.
Foundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other organisms
that use them. An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef (Figure 45.28). Corals themselves are not photosynthetic,
but harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform photosynthesis; this is
another example of a mutualism. The exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef structure, which protects
many other species from waves and ocean currents.

Everyday Connection
Invasive Species
Invasive species are nonnative organisms that, when introduced to an area out of their native range, threaten the ecosystem
balance of that habitat. Many such species exist in the United States, as shown inFigure 45.31. Whether enjoying a forest
hike, taking a summer boat trip, or simply walking down an urban street, you have likely encountered an invasive species.
Figure45.31In the United States, invasive species like (a) purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and the (b) zebra mussel (Dreissena
polymorpha) threaten certain aquatic ecosystems. Some forests are threatened by the spread of (c) common buckthorn (Rhamnus
cathartica), (d) garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), and (e) the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). The (f) European starling
(Sturnus vulgaris) may compete with native bird species for nest holes. (credit a: modification of work by Liz West; credit b:

Davison; credit e: modification of work by USDA; credit f: modification of work by Don DeBold)
One of the many recent proliferations of an invasive species concerns the growth of Asian carp populations. Asian carp were
introduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries and sewage treatment facilities that used the fish’s excellent filter
feeding capabilities to clean their ponds of excess plankton. Some of the fish escaped, however, and by the 1980s they had
colonized many waterways of the Mississippi River basin, including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.

Secondary succession
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire (Figure 45.33). Wildfires will burn
most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form
of ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold.
Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height
gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no
longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing
and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth
of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These
organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species
composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the
climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.
Figure45.33Secondary succession is shown in an oak and hickory forest after a forest fire.

availability, and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals. Birds fly south for the winter to get to
warmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds. The popular 2005 documentaryMarch of
the Penguinsfollowed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site
and to their young. Wildebeests (Figure 45.35) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands.
Figure45.35Wildebeests migrate in a clockwise fashion over 1800 miles each year in search of rain-ripened grass. (credit: Eric Inafuku)
Although migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration). Animals
that exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not. Additionally, in some animals, only a portion of the population
migrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration). For example, owls that live in the tundra may migrate in
years when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when rodents are plentiful.
Foraging
Foragingis the act of searching for and exploiting food resources. Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize
energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section. The painted stork, for
example, uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for crabs and other food (Figure 45.36).
Figure45.36The painted stork uses its long beak to forage. (credit: J.M. Garg)
Innate Behaviors: Living in Groups
Not all animals live in groups, but even those that live relatively solitary lives, with the exception of those that can reproduce
asexually, must mate. Mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the desire to mate. There are
several types of energy-intensive behaviors or displays associated with mating, called mating rituals. Other behaviors found in
populations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal benefits from the behavior. In selfish behavior, only the
animal in question benefits; in altruistic behavior, one animal’s actions benefit another animal; cooperative behavior describes
when both animals benefit. All of these behaviors involve some sort of communication between population members.
Communication within a Species
Animals communicate with each other using stimuli known assignals. An example of this is seen in the three-spined
stickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals
females to mate. Other signals are chemical (pheromones), aural (sound), visual (courtship and aggressive displays), or tactile
(touch). These types of communication may be instinctual or learned or a combination of both. These are not the same as the

Altruistic Behaviors
Behaviors that lower the fitness of the individual but increase the fitness of another individual are termed altruistic. Examples
of such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom. Social insects such as worker bees have no ability to reproduce, yet
they maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring. Meerkats keep a sentry standing guard to warn the rest
of the colony about intruders, even though the sentry is putting itself at risk. Wolves and wild dogs bring meat to pack members
not present during a hunt. Lemurs take care of infants unrelated to them. Although on the surface, these behaviors appear to be
altruistic, the truth may not be so simple.
There has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist. Do these behaviors lead to overall evolutionary advantages
for their species? Do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes? And what about such activities between unrelated
individuals? One explanation for altruistic-type behaviors is found in the genetics of natural selection. In the 1976 book,The
Selfish Gene,scientist Richard Dawkins attempted to explain many seemingly altruistic behaviors from the viewpoint of the
gene itself. Although a gene obviously cannot be selfish in the human sense, it may appear that way if the sacrifice of an
individual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives because of common
lineage). Mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring. Emperor penguins migrate miles in harsh
conditions to bring food back for their young. Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and is still discussed
among scientists in related fields.
Even less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from seemingly
altruistic behavior. The activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples. Sterile workers in
these societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring, she is passing on
genes from the workers indirectly. Thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct
chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility. The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a
relative and thus one’s inclusive fitness evolves throughkin selection. This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic
behaviors seen in animals. However, these behaviors may not be truly defined as altruism in these cases because the actor is
actually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or indirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains
through relatives that share genes with it).
Unrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the “selfish gene” explanation. An example
of this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that individual
pick the parasites from its fur. After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now grooms the
second monkey. Thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior. Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness is raised more than
if neither cooperated nor if one cooperated and the other did not cooperate. This behavior is still not necessarily altruism, as the
“giving” behavior of the actor is based on the expectation that it will be the “receiver” of the behavior in the future, termed
reciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each other, often the result of living in
the same social group, and that cheaters (those that never “give back”) are punished.
Evolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called
“altruistic behaviors” are not altruistic at all. The definition of “pure” altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that
benefits another without any direct benefit to oneself. Most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this
definition, and game theorists are good at finding “selfish” components in them. Others have argued that the terms “selfish” and
“altruistic” should be dropped completely when discussing animal behavior, as they describe human behavior and may not be
directly applicable to instinctual animal activity. What is clear, though, is that heritable behaviors that improve the chances of
passing on one’s genes or a portion of one’s genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future generations as
long as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage. These instinctual behaviors may then be applied, in special circumstances, to
other species, as long as it doesn’t lower the animal’s fitness.
Finding Sex Partners
Not all animals reproduce sexually, but many that do have the same challenge: they need to find a suitable mate and often have
to compete with other individuals to obtain one. Significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and mating
with the sex partner. Two types of selection occur during this process:intersexual selection, where individuals of one sex choose
mates of the other sex, andintrasexual selection, the competition for mates between species members of the same sex.
Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual, aural, tactile, and chemical

Simple Learned Behaviors
The majority of the behaviors previously discussed were innate or at least have an innate component (variations on the innate
behaviors may be learned). They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from the environment.
Conversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism to adapt to changes in the
environment and are modified by previous experiences. Simple learned behaviors include habituation and imprinting—both are
important to the maturation process of young animals.
Habituation
Habituationis a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure.
This is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward. Prairie dogs
typically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human footsteps when
no harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call. In this example,
habituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential predators.
Imprinting
Imprintingis a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species
involved. Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her. A familiar sight is
ducklings walking or swimming after their mothers (Figure 45.39). This is another type of non-associative learning, but is very
important in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so they will be protected,
greatly increasing their chances of survival. However, if newborn ducks see a human before they see their mother, they will
imprint on the human and follow it in just the same manner as they would follow their real mother.
Figure45.39The attachment of ducklings to their mother is an example of imprinting. (credit: modification of work by Mark Harkin)
LINK TO LEARNING
The International Crane Foundation has helped raise the world’s population of whooping cranes from 21 individuals to about
600. Imprinting hatchlings has been a key to success: biologists wear full crane costumes so the birds never “see” humans.

Conditioned Behavior
Conditioned behaviorsare types of associative learning, where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence. During
operant conditioning, the behavioral response is modified by its consequences, with regards to its form, strength, or frequency.
Classical Conditioning
Inclassical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not
been associated with, the conditioned stimulus. The response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the
unconditioned response. The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov’s experiments with dogs (Figure 45.40).
In Pavlov’s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned stimulus of
seeing or smelling their food. The conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned response was the
ringing of a bell. During conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung. This was repeated during several
trials. After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond by salivating. After the

method of human learning. In fact, that is how students are learning right now by reading this book. As students read, they can
make mental images of objects or organisms and imagine changes to them, or behaviors by them, and anticipate the
consequences. In addition to visual processing, cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past experiences, touching
physical objects, hearing sounds, tasting food, and a variety of other sensory-based inputs. Cognitive learning is so powerful
that it can be used to understand conditioning in detail. In the reverse scenario, conditioning cannot help someone learn about
cognition.
Classic work on cognitive learning was done by Wolfgang Köhler with chimpanzees. He demonstrated that these animals were
capable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle. When a banana was hung in their cage too
high for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack the boxes
one on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana. This implies that they could visualize the result of stacking the
boxes even before they had performed the action. This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile than conditioning.
Cognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it. Maze running experiments done
with rats by H.C. Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal. The motivation for the
animals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end. In these studies, the animals in Group I were run in
one trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run (Figure 45.42). Group II rats were not fed in
the maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after. Group III rats had food
available on the third day and every day thereafter. The results were that the control rats, Group I, learned quickly, and figured
out how to run the maze in seven days. Group III did not learn much during the three days without food, but rapidly caught up
to the control group when given the food reward. Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no reward to motivate them,
and they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it took two days longer to learn the
maze.
Figure45.42Group I (the green solid line) found food at the end of each trial, group II (the blue dashed line) did not find food for the first 6
days, and group III (the red dotted line) did not find food during runs on the first three days. Notice that rats given food earlier learned
faster and eventually caught up to the control group. The orange dots on the group II and III lines show the days when food rewards were
added to the mazes.
It may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning. Although one might be tempted to
believe that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, E.C. Tolman
proved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds, which he called a “cognitive map.”
This was an early demonstration of the power of cognitive learning and how these abilities were not just limited to humans.

life, while the rocky desert of (b) Boa Vista island, Cape Verde, Africa, is devoid of plant life. (credit a: modification of work by Jay Galvin;

Ecosystems are complex with many interacting parts. They are routinely exposed to various disturbances, or changes in the
environment that effect their compositions: yearly variations in rainfall and temperature and the slower processes of plant
growth, which may take several years. Many of these disturbances result from natural processes. For example, when lightning
causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated by grasses, then by bushes and
shrubs, and later by mature trees, restoring the forest to its former state. The impact of environmental disturbances caused by
human activities is as important as the changes wrought by natural processes. Human agricultural practices, air pollution, acid
rain, global deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, oil spills, and waste dumping on land and into the ocean are all issues of
concern to conservationists.
Equilibriumis the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each other.
In ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience.Resistanceis the ability of an
ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances.Resilienceis the speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium
after being disturbed. Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact. The
nature of an ecosystem may change to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely. This process can lead to the complete
destruction or irreversible altering of the ecosystem.
Food Chains and Food Webs
The term “food chain” is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations. Individuals who are considered
successful are seen as being at the top of the food chain, consuming all others for their benefit, whereas the less successful are
seen as being at the bottom.
The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage. In ecology, afood chainis a linear
sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level
consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. There is a single path through the chain. Each organism in a
food chain occupies what is called atrophic level. Depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or groups of
species can be assigned to various trophic levels.
In many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton), which
are calledprimary producers. The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: theprimary consumers.
Secondary consumersare usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers.Tertiary consumersare carnivores that eat other
carnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the organisms at the top of the food
chain: theapex consumers. In the Lake Ontario food chain shown inFigure 46.4, the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at
the top of this food chain.

Figure46.5The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem is shown. Each trophic level has less energy
available and supports fewer organisms at the next level.
There is a one problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems. Even when all organisms are grouped
into appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise, some of
these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels. In other words, the linear model of ecosystems, the food
chain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure. A holistic model—which accounts for all the interactions between
different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment—is a more accurate
and descriptive model for ecosystems. Afood webis a graphic representation of a holistic, nonlinear web of primary producers,
primary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics (Figure 46.6).
Figure46.6This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels in the Lake Ontario ecosystem. Primary
producers are outlined in green, primary consumers in orange, secondary consumers in blue, and tertiary (apex) consumers in purple.
Arrows point from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes it. Notice how some lines point to more than one trophic
level. For example, the opossum shrimp eats both primary producers and primary consumers. (credit: NOAA, GLERL)
A comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both. Food chains are more flexible for
analytical modeling, are easier to follow, and are easier to experiment with, whereas food web models more accurately represent
ecosystem structure and dynamics, and data can be directly used as input for simulation modeling.

Research into Ecosystem Dynamics: Ecosystem Experimentation and
Modeling
The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment (disturbances) or by internal forces is
calledecosystem dynamics. Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies. Some ecologists study
ecosystems using controlled experimental systems, while some study entire ecosystems in their natural state, and others use
both approaches.
Aholistic ecosystem modelattempts to quantify the composition, interaction, and dynamics of entire ecosystems; it is the most
representative of the ecosystem in its natural state. A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model. However, this type
of study is limited by time and expense, as well as the fact that it is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments on large
natural ecosystems. It is difficult to quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat, especially
when studying large habitats such as the Amazon Rainforest.
For these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions. Experimental systems usually involve either
partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed amesocosm, or by recreating an ecosystem
entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as amicrocosm. A major limitation to these
approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through
partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. These changes are often due to differences in species numbers and
diversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or recreating (microcosm) the natural habitat.
Thus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem from which they were
gathered.
As both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems should
be used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem structure,
function, and dynamics.
Scientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure
and dynamics of ecosystems. They use three basic types of ecosystem modeling in research and ecosystem management: a
conceptual model, an analytical model, and a simulation model. Aconceptual modelis an ecosystem model that consists of flow
charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem. A conceptual
model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem; however,
its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited. Analytical and simulation models, in contrast, are mathematical
methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without
direct experimentation, although with some limitations as to accuracy. Ananalytical modelis an ecosystem model that is
created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and
dynamics. Asimulation modelis an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model
ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Ideally, these
models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and
they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers (such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical

Why do you think the value for gross productivity of the primary producers is the same as the value for total heat and respiration
(20,810 kcal/m2/yr)?
Analytical and Simulation Models
The major limitation of conceptual models is their inability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem species and/or
environment. Ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic disturbances caused by natural
forces and/or human activity. Ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium state can often recover from such disturbances
and return to a state of equilibrium. As most ecosystems are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in a state of change,
they are usually either moving toward or away from their equilibrium state. There are many of these equilibrium states among
the various components of an ecosystem, which affects the ecosystem overall. Furthermore, as humans have the ability to
greatly and rapidly alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem, the need for predictive models that enable
understanding of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial.
Analytical models often use simple, linear components of ecosystems, such as food chains, and are known to be complex

Energy Flow through Ecosystems
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe how organisms acquire energy in a food web and in associated food chains
• Explain how the efficiency of energy transfers between trophic levels affects ecosystem structure and
dynamics
• Discuss trophic levels and how ecological pyramids are used to model them
All living things require energy in one form or another. Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often in the
form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller compounds, and
life itself is an energy-driven process. Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic
acids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input.
It is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to another
through food webs and their constituent food chains. Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems,
including how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the food web.
How Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web
Energy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of other
living or previously living organisms by heterotrophs.
Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable of
synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). Photosynthetic
autotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use
inorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems. Without these organisms, energy would not
be available to other living organisms and life itself would not be possible.
Photoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the world’s
ecosystems. These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs. Photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the sun by
converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP). The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize complex organic
molecules, such as glucose.
Chemoautotrophsare primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in those
associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (Figure 46.9). Many chemoautotrophs in
hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy. This allows
2
chemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies energy to
the rest of the ecosystem.

Figure46.9Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent at the bottom of the
ocean. As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic bacteria and organic material that sinks
from the ocean’s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summit of this highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface.
Productivity within Trophic Levels
Productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass
in a particular trophic level.Biomassis the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or previously living
organisms within a trophic level. Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level. For example, in the
English Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2(grams per square meter), while the primary
consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2.
The productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to
other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy. The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers
incorporate energy from the sun is calledgross primary productivity. An example of gross primary productivity is shown in the
compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (Figure 46.8). In this ecosystem, the
total energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810 kcal/m2/yr.
Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss)
scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem.Net primary productivityis the energy that remains in
the primary producers after accounting for the organisms’ respiration and heat loss. The net productivity is then available to the
primary consumers at the next trophic level. In our Silver Springs example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr were used for
respiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,633 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers.
Ecological Efficiency: The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels
As illustrated in (Figure 46.8), as energy flows from primary producers through the various trophic levels, the ecosystem loses
large amounts of energy. The main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy
is converted from one form to another, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system. In biologic systems, this
energy takes the form of metabolic heat, which is lost when the organisms consume other organisms. In the Silver Springs
ecosystem example (Figure 46.8), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of
energy available to them from the primary producers. The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive
trophic levels is termed thetrophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE)and is defined by the formula:
In Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent. The low efficiency of energy

inverted pyramids of numbers, this inverted pyramid is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers, but results
from the high turnover rate of the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary consumers, thus,
minimizing their biomass at any particular point in time. However, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus they are able to
support the rest of the ecosystem.
Pyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels. Notice that these numbers are the
same as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in (Figure 46.8). Pyramids of energy are always upright, and an
ecosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported. All types of ecological pyramids are useful for
characterizing ecosystem structure. However, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are the
most consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure (Figure 46.10).

Pyramids depicting the number of organisms or biomass may be inverted, upright, or even diamond-shaped. Energy pyramids,
however, are always upright. Why?
Consequences of Food Webs: Biological Magnification
One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification.Biomagnificationis the
increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers to the
apex consumers. Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including the pesticidedichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT), which was described in the 1960s bestseller,Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson. DDT was a commonly used pesticide before
its dangers became known. In some aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms of the
lower level, which caused DDT to increase in birds (apex consumers) that ate fish. Thus, the birds accumulated sufficient
amounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells. This effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was shown to have
adverse effects on these bird populations. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in the 1970s.
Other substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were used in coolant liquids in the United States
until their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. These substances were best studied

Biogeochemical Cycles
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Discuss the biogeochemical cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur
• Explain how human activities have impacted these cycles and the potential consequences for Earth
Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving
as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels. However, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and
recycled. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules—carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,
and sulfur—take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the
Earth’s surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates,
all play a role in this recycling of materials. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the
recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called abiogeochemical cycle.
Water contains hydrogen and oxygen, which is essential to all living processes. Thehydrosphereis the area of the Earth where
water movement and storage occurs. On or beneath the surface, water occurs in liquid or solid form in rivers, lakes, oceans,
groundwater, polar ice caps, and glaciers. And it occurs as water vapor in the atmosphere. Carbon is found in all organic
macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and proteins
and is critical to human agriculture. Phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acid (along with nitrogen), is one of the main
ingredients in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface water. Sulfur is

critical to the 3-D folding of proteins, such as in disulfide binding.
The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen and
phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon. Thus, mineral nutrients
are cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere, from one living organism to another, and between the biotic
and abiotic world.

The Water (Hydrologic) Cycle
Water is the basis of all living processes on Earth. When examining the stores of water on Earth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable
salt water (Figure 46.12). Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground as water or as ice. Thus, less than 1 percent of
fresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers. Many living things, such as plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on
that small amount of fresh surface water, a lack of which can have massive effects on ecosystem dynamics. To be successful,
organisms must adapt to fluctuating water supplies. Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water
availability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water
from the ocean.
Figure46.12Only 2.5 percent of water on Earth is fresh water, and less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible to living things.
Water cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics. Water has a major influence on climate and, thus, on the
environments of ecosystems. Most of the water on Earth is stored for long periods in the oceans, underground, and as ice.
Figure 46.13illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the Earth’s major water reservoirs.
Residence timeis a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir.

falls as rain or snow. Precipitated water may enter freshwater bodies or infiltrate the soil. The cycle is complete when surface or
groundwater reenters the ocean. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)
The Carbon Cycle
Carbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms. Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the
structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms.
The carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living
organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes. The entire carbon cycle is
shown inFigure 46.15.

• Biogeochemical Cycles 1359
As stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the process of
photosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The
exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location, and
each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO ) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines with water
2
molecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Figure 46.16)
Figure46.16Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions.
The equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions. Some of
these ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (CaCO), a major component of marine organism shells.
3
These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone,
which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.
On land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering of
terrestrial rock and minerals. This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff. Deeper underground, on
land and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels
are considered a nonrenewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. Anonrenewable resource, such
as fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land
(including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments
from the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process ofsubduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath
another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents.
Humans contribute to atmospheric carbon by the burning of fossil fuels and other materials. Since the Industrial Revolution,
humans have significantly increased the release of carbon and carbon compounds, which has in turn affected the climate and
overall environment.
Animal husbandry by humans also increases atmospheric carbon. The large numbers of land animals raised to feed the Earth’s
growing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to farming practices and respiration and
methane production. This is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant
way. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on
fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and respiration, into account as they model and predict the
future impact of this increase.
The Nitrogen Cycle
Getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the
atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N ) even though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent
2
of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their
macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N ). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is
2
present; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to “fix” nitrogen.
Rhizobiumbacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with
the organic nitrogen they need. (For example, gardeners often grow peas both for their produce and to naturally add nitrogen to
the soil. This practice goes back to ancient times, even if the science has only been recently understood.) Free-living bacteria,
such asAzotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers.
Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary
production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown inFigure 46.17, the nitrogen that
enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria.
This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. First, the
ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into ammonium

The Phosphorus Cycle
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acid and phospholipids, and, as
calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for
growth) in aquatic ecosystems (Figure 46.18).
Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO 3−). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural
4
surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers,
lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the
bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may
also be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of areas of the
Earth’s surface.
Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems. The movement of
phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic
residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.
Figure46.18In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO4 3−). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity releases phosphate into
the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters the oceans via surface runoff, groundwater
flow, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine food webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to
the ocean floor, where it forms sediment. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)

The Chesapeake Bay has long been valued as one of the most scenic areas on Earth; it is now in distress and is recognized as
a declining ecosystem. In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first ecosystems to have identified dead zones,
which continue to kill many fish and bottom-dwelling species, such as clams, oysters, and worms. Several species have
declined in the Chesapeake Bay due to surface water runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on
land. The source of the fertilizers (with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There
are many nearby urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff
from lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of
industry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners.
Of particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster
reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000 acres. Oyster harvesting was once a
major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. This decline was due not only to
fertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting. Oysters require a certain minimum population density because
they must be in close proximity to reproduce. Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly
disrupting the ecosystem.
The restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. Not
only do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters are filter feeders, and as they eat, they
clean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the
entire volume of the bay. Today, with changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take
nearly a year to do the same job.
Restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by nonprofit organizations, such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many
disease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for the College of William and Mary) are
now available and have been used in the construction of experimental oyster reefs. Efforts to clean and restore the bay by
Virginia and Delaware have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which
stresses the need for interstate cooperation to gain successful restoration.
The new, hearty oyster strains have also spawned a new and economically viable industry—oyster aquaculture—which not
only supplies oysters for food and profit, but also has the added benefit of cleaning the bay.
The Sulfur Cycle
Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things. As a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved in the
formation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-D folding patterns, and hence their functions. As
shown inFigure 46.21, sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of
sulfur dioxide (SO ) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules, from volcanic
2
activity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.

Sulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents. Some
ecosystems (Figure 46.9) rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports marine
ecosystems in the form of sulfates.
Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities of
fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere.Acid rainis caused by
rainwater falling to the ground through this sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid. Acid rain damages the natural
environment by lowering the pH of lakes, which kills many of the resident fauna; it also affects the man-made environment
through the chemical degradation of buildings. For example, many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years.

The Biodiversity Crisis
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define biodiversity in terms of species diversity and abundance
• Describe biodiversity as the equilibrium of naturally fluctuating rates of extinction and
speciation
• Identify historical causes of high extinction rates in Earth’s history
Traditionally, ecologists have measuredbiodiversity, a general term for the number of species present in the
biosphere, by taking into account both the number of species and their relative abundance to each other.
Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living organisms. These estimation
indices, which came frominformation theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity
between and within ecosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists
is simply the loss of biodiversity. However, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of
species diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve the biologically or technologically important elements of
biodiversity.
The Lake Victoria cichlids provide an example with which we can begin to understand biodiversity. The
biologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of
specializations to specialized habitat types and specific feeding strategies: such as eating plankton floating
in the water, scraping/eating algae from rocks, eating insect larvae from the lake bottom, and eating the
eggs of other species of cichlid. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are the product of an complexadaptive
radiation. Anadaptive radiationis a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the Lake Victoria
cichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic clade into many closely related species. Typically,
the species “radiate” into different habitats and niches. The Galápagos Island finches are an example of a
modest adaptive radiation with 15 species. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are an example of a spectacular
adaptive radiation that formerly included about 500 species.
At the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear. A culprit in
these declines was the Nile perch, a species of large predatory fish that was introduced to Lake Victoria by
fisheries to feed the people living around the lake. The Nile perch was introduced in 1963, but its populations
did not begin to surge until the 1980s. The perch population grew by consuming cichlids, driving species
after species to the point ofextinction(the disappearance of a species). In fact, there were several factors
that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria: the Nile perch, declining
lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria, and increased fishing
pressure. Scientists had not even catalogued all of the species present—so many were lost that were never
named. The diversity is now a shadow of what it once was.
The cichlids of Lake Victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over
Earth that is caused primarily by human activity. Extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that
occurs at the rate of about one out of 1 million species becoming extinct per year. The fossil record reveals
that there have been five periods ofmass extinctionin history with much higher rates of species loss, and
the rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of mass extinction. However, there is a major
difference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction we are experiencing: human
activity. Specifically, three human activities have a major impact: 1) destruction of habitat, 2) introduction of
exotic species, and 3) over-harvesting. Predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of
time on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent. Extinctions on this scale have only
happened five other times in the history of the planet, and these extinctions were caused by cataclysmic
events that changed the course of the history of life in each instance.
Types of Biodiversity
Scientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species and their
abundance in a given location or on the planet. Species can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel
comfortable with the concept and are able to identify and count eukaryotic species in most contexts.
Biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which are important for planning

how to preserve biodiversity.
Genetic diversityis one of those alternate concepts.Genetic diversity, or genetic variation defines the raw material for evolution
and adaptation in a species. A species’ future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of
the individuals in populations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very
different types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that are genetically similar and have similar
ecologies. If there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for
subsequent evolution is the mostgenetically diverseone.
Many genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing.
Genetic diversity can be measured aschemical diversityin that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells,
both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. This chemical diversity has potential benefit for
humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and
welfare.
Humans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi, among many other organisms. This diversity is also
suffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in densely populated
regions such as China, India, and Japan. The human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its
decline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists.
It is also useful to defineecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or within a given
geographic area (Figure 47.2). Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other
ecosystems. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of
coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct
ecosystem in North America is theprairie ecosystem. Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in
northern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl.
Many of the species survive elsewhere, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most
productive agricultural soils in the United States is now gone. As a consequence, native soils are disappearing or must be
maintained and enhanced at great expense.

There are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible ways, and the internet is facilitating that effort.
Nevertheless, it has been pointed out that at the current rate of new species descriptions (which according to the State of
Observed Species Report is 17,000 to 20,000 new species per year), it will take close to 500 years to finish describing life on this
planet.4Over time, the task becomes both increasingly difficult and increasingly easier as extinction removes species from the
planet.
Naming and counting species may seem like an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but determining
biodiversity it is not simply an accounting of species. Describing a species is a complex process through which biologists
determine an organism’s unique characteristics and whether or not that organism belongs to any other described species or
genus. It allows biologists to find and recognize the species after the initial discovery, and allows them to follow up on questions
about its biology. In addition, the unique characteristics of each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species
on which humans depend.
Patterns of Biodiversity
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth. Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone, ignoring the other
fish families present in the lake. All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria; therefore, the 500 species of cichlids were
endemic.Endemic speciesare found in only one location. Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly
vulnerable to extinction. Higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic. Lake Michigan contains
about 79 species of fish, many of which are found in other lakes in North America. What accounts for the difference in fish
diversity in these two lakes? Lake Victoria is an ancient tropical lake, while Lake Michigan is a recently formed temperate lake.
Lake Michigan in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old,
although its basin is about 400,000 years in age. Biogeographers have suggested these two factors, latitude and age, are two of
several hypotheses to explain biodiversity patterns on the planet.

Regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics. Additionally, therate of
endemismis highest, and there are more biodiversity “hotspots.” However, this richness of diversity also means that knowledge
of species is unfortunately very low, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss.
Conservation of Biodiversity
In 1988, British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at
significant risk for species loss:biodiversity hotspots.Biodiversity hotspotsare geographical areas that contain high numbers
of endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts, a kind
of conservation triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species. The original criteria
for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area disturbed by human
activity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 47.4) containing large numbers of endemic species, which include half of
Earth’s endemic plants.
Figure47.4Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots, which cover only 2.3 percent of the Earth’s surface but have
endemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world’s plants.
Biodiversity Change through Geological Time
The number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary processes
that are continuously ongoing:speciationandextinction. Both are natural “birth” and “death” processes of macroevolution.
When speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species
will decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout Earth’s history, these two processes have
fluctuated—sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record (Figure
47.5).

85 percent of marine species (few species lived outside the oceans) became extinct. The main hypothesis for its cause is a period
of glaciation and then warming. The extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by about 1 million
years. The first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming. The climate changes
affected temperatures and sea levels. Some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a nearby supernova,
was a possible cause of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The gamma-ray burst would have stripped away the Earth’s
protective ozone layer, allowing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the surface of the earth—andmayaccount for
climate changes observed at the time. The hypothesis is very speculative, and extraterrestrial influences on Earth’s history are an
active line of research. Recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the
location.
Thelate Devonian extinctionmay have occurred over a relatively long period of time. It appears to have mostly affected marine
species and not so much the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats. The causes of this extinction are poorly
understood.
Theend-Permian extinctionwas the largest in the history of life. Indeed, an argument could be made that Earth became nearly
devoid of life during this extinction event. Estimates are that 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial
species were lost. It was at this time, for example, that the trilobites, a group that survived the Ordovician–Silurian extinction,
became extinct. The causes for this mass extinction are not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic
activity that led to a runaway global-warming event. The oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life. Terrestrial
tetrapod diversity took 30 million years to recover after the end-Permian extinction. The Permian extinction dramatically altered
Earth’s biodiversity makeup and the course of evolution.
The causes of theTriassic–Jurassicextinction event are not clear, and researchers argue hypotheses including climate change,
asteroid impact, and volcanic eruptions. The extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea,
although recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the Triassic.
The causes of the end-Cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood. It was during this extinction event
about 65 million years ago that the majority of the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared
from the planet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds).
The cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large meteorite, or asteroid, off the
coast of what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. This hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was a radical explanation based on a sharp
spike in the levels ofiridium(which enters our atmosphere from meteors at a fairly constant rate but is otherwise absent on
Earth’s surface) in the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods (Figure 47.6). This
boundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many other taxa. The researchers who discovered the
iridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the atmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather
than a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period. It was a radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately
aged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more believable. Now an abundance of geological evidence supports
the theory. Recovery times for biodiversity after the end-Cretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for the end-
Permian extinction, on the order of 10 million years.
Another possibility, perhaps coincidental with the impact of the Yucatan asteroid, was extensive volcanism that began forming
about 66 million years ago, about the same time as the Yucatan asteroid impact, at the end of the Cretaceous. The lava flows
covered over 50 percent of what is now India. The release of volcanic gases, particularly sulphur dioxide, during the formation of
the traps contributed to climate change, which may have induced the mass extinction.

Recent Extinctions
The sixth, orHolocene, mass extinctionappears to have begun earlier than previously believed and is largely due to the
disruptive activities of modernHomo sapiens. Since the beginning of the Holocene period, there are numerous recent
extinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the
European colonies since the 1500s.
One of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The odd pigeon-like bird lived in the forests of Mauritius (an
island in the Indian Ocean) and became extinct around 1662. The dodo was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey
because it approached people without fear (the dodo had not evolved with humans). Pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by
European ships also killed dodo young and eggs.
Steller's sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the northwest coast of North
America. Steller's sea cow was first discovered by Europeans in 1741 and was overhunted for meat and oil. The last sea cow was
killed in 1768. That amounts to just 27 years between the sea cow’s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the species!
Since 1900, a variety of species have gone extinct, including the following:
• In 1914, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio. This species had once darkened the skies of North
America during its migrations, but it was overhunted and suffered from habitat loss that resulted from the clearing of
forests for farmland.
• The Carolina parakeet, once common in the eastern United States, died out in 1918. It suffered habitat loss and was hunted
to prevent it from eating orchard fruit. (The parakeet ate orchard fruit because its native foods were destroyed to make way
for farmland.)
• The Japanese sea lion, which inhabited a broad area around Japan and the coast of Korea, became extinct in the 1950s due to
fishermen.
• The Caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the Caribbean Sea but was driven to extinction via hunting by 1952.
These are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called theRed List. The list is not complete, but it describes 380 extinct
species of vertebrates after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.
Estimates of Present-Time Extinction Rates
Estimates ofextinction ratesare hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation. The
extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way. But
there are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed.
Thebackground extinctionrate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (E/MSY). For example, assuming there
are about ten million species in existence, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each year
represents ten million species per year).
One contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. For birds alone this
method yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY. However, this value may be an underestimate for three reasons. First, many species
would not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed. Second, the
number of recently extinct vertebrate species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal
remains. And third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such.
Taking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 E/MSY. The predicted rate by the end of the
century is 1500 E/MSY.
A second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest-
area loss and understanding species-area relationships. Thespecies-area relationshipis the rate at which new species are seen
when the area surveyed is increased. Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island
increases. This phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other island-like habitats as well, such as the mountain-top
tepuis of Venezuela, which are surrounded by tropical forest. Turning this relationship around, if the habitat area is reduced,
the number of species living there will also decline. Estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and species-area
relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would become extinct.
Species-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 E/MSY and higher. In general, actual
observations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there is a delay in extinction. Recent work
has also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when estimating the loss of species. This work

The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify chemical diversity benefits to humans
• Identify biodiversity components that support human agriculture
• Describe ecosystem services
It may not be clear why biologists are concerned about biodiversity loss. When biodiversity loss is thought of as the extinction of
the passenger pigeon, the dodo bird, and even the woolly mammoth, the loss may appear to be an emotional one. But is the loss
practically important for the welfare of the human species? From the perspective of evolution and ecology, the loss of a
particular individual species is unimportant (however, we should note that the loss of a keystone species can lead to ecological
disaster). Extinction is a normal part of macroevolution. But theaccelerated extinction ratetranslates into the loss of tens of
thousands of species within our lifetimes, and it is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of
ecosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health.
Agriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate
environment. This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living
things on the planet. Biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as
every other species on the planet is dependent. Technology smooths out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human
species cannot exist without a supportive ecosystem.
Human Health
Archeological evidence indicates that humans have been using plants for medicinal uses for thousands of years. A Chinese
document from approximately 2800 BC is believed to be the the first written account of herbal remedies, and such references
occur throughout the global historical record. Contemporary indigenous societies that live close to the land often retain broad
knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. Most plants producesecondary plant compounds, which are
toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication.
Modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. Examples of significant medicines

derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine (Figure 47.8). Many medicines were
once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs
contained at least one plant extract. That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are
replaced by synthetic versions. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in
developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.
Figure47.8Catharanthus roseus, the Madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties. Among other uses, it is a source of
vincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas. (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)
In recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential. By 2007, the FDA had
approved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes. Another five
drugs are undergoing clinical trials, and at least six drugs are being used in other countries. Other toxins under investigation
come from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions.
Aside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medicines improve people’s lives. Pharmaceutical companies are
always looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as medicines. It is estimated that 1/3 of
pharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to
market between 1981 and 2002 were derived from natural compounds. The opportunities for new medications will be reduced in
direct proportion to the disappearance of species.
Agricultural Diversity
Since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop
varieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example, potatoes
were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The potatoes grown in that region
belong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. Even the Inca capital of Machu Picchu had
numerous gardens growing varieties of potatoes. Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and
climate conditions. The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the topography, the limited movement of people, and the
demands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields.
Potatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by
humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value,
adaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests.
The potato also demonstrates risks of low crop diversity. The tragic Irish potato famine occurred when the single variety grown
in Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight, wiping out the entire crop. The loss of the potato crop led to mass famine and
the related deaths of over one million people, as well as mass emigration of nearly two million people.
Disease resistance is a chief benefit of crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks.
Seed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to
keep up with evolving pest organisms. These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of
varieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world.
The ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related to

enemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms. An experimental study found
that introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly. This study
shows the importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at control than one
single pest; the results showed this to be the case. Loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it more difficult and
costly to grow food.
Wild Food Sources
In addition to growing crops and raising animals for food, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily fish
populations. In fact, for approximately 1 billion people worldwide, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein.
But since 1990, global fish production has declined, sometimes dramatically. Unfortunately, and despite considerable effort, few
fisheries on the planet are managed for sustainability.
Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine
ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. In addition to humans
losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict. The collapse
of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local populations that work in the fishery. In addition, the loss of an
inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in
other ways. In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger species are fished to extinction. The
ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources.

Psychological and Moral Value
Finally, it has been clearly shown that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. A chief proponent of this
idea is Harvard entomologist E. O. Wilson. He argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to live in a natural
environment and that city environments generate psychological stressors that affect human health and well-being. There is
considerable research into the psychological regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold
some truth. In addition, there is a moral argument that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other
species.

## Section 883.2
Threats to Biodiversity
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify significant threats to biodiversity
• Explain the effects of habitat loss, the introduction of exotic species, and hunting on biodiversity
• Identify the early and predicted effects of climate change on biodiversity
The core threat to biodiversity on the planet, and therefore a threat to human welfare, is the combination of human population
growth and resource exploitation. The human population requires resources to survive and grow, and those resources are being
removed unsustainably from the environment. The three greatest proximate threats to biodiversity are habitat loss,
overharvesting, and the introduction of exotic species. The first two of these are a direct result of human population growth and
resource use. The third results from increased mobility and trade. A fourth major cause of extinction, anthropogenic climate
change, has not yet had a large impact, but it is predicted to become significant during this century. Global climate change is
also a consequence of human population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs (Figure 47.10).
Environmental issues, such as toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on species, but they are not generally seen as threats
at the magnitude of the others.

Everyday Connection
Preventing Habitat Destruction with Wise Wood Choices
Most consumers are not aware that the home improvement products they buy might be contributing to habitat loss and
species extinctions. Yet the market for illegally harvested tropical timber is huge, and the wood products often find
themselves in building supply stores in the United States. One estimate is that 10 percent of the imported timber stream in
the United States, which is the world’s largest consumer of wood products, is potentially illegally logged. In 2006, this
amounted to $3.6 billion in wood products. Most of the illegal products are imported from countries that act as

Bush meatis the generic term used for wild animals killed for food. Hunting is practiced throughout the world, but hunting
practices, particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia, are believed to threaten a number of species with extinction.
Traditionally, bush meat in Africa was hunted to feed families directly; however, recent commercialization of the practice now
has bush meat available in grocery stores, which has increased harvest rates to the level of unsustainability. Additionally, human
population growth has increased the need for protein foods that are not being met from agriculture. Species threatened by the
bush meat trade are mostly mammals including many primates living in the Congo basin.
Exotic Species
Exotic speciesare species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an ecosystem in which they did not
evolve. For example, Kudzu (Pueraria lobata), which is native to Japan, was introduced in the United States in 1876. It was later
planted for soil conservation. Problematically, it grows too well in the southeastern United States—up to a foot a day. It is now
an invasive pest species and covers over 7 million acres in the southeastern United States. If an introduced species is able to
survive in its new habitat, that introduction is now reflected in the observed range of the species. Human transportation of
people and goods, including the intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of
species into new ecosystems, sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and
outside the range of the species’ natural predators.
Most exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor adaptation to the
ecosystem they enter. Some species, however, possess pre-adaptations that can make them especially successful in a new
ecosystem. These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological
conditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there. For this reason, exotic species are also called
invasive species. Exotic species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease. For
example, the Eurasian star thistle, also called spotted knapweed, has invaded and rendered useless some of the open prairies of
the western states. However, it is a great nectar-bearing flower for the production of honey and supports numerous pollinating
insects, including migrating monarch butterflies in the north-central states such as Michigan.

Lakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats from introduced species. In Lake Victoria, as mentioned
earlier, the intentional introduction of the Nile perch was largely responsible for the extinction of about 200 species of endemic
cichlids. The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft (Figure 47.12) from the Solomon Islands to Guam in
1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the island. Several other
species are still threatened. The brown tree snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate; one was
even found on an aircraft arriving in Corpus Christi, Texas. Constant vigilance on the part of airport, military, and commercial
aircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific, especially Hawaii.
Islands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain a disproportionate number of endemic species
because of their isolation from mainland ancestors.

Climate Change
Climate change, and specifically theanthropogenic(meaning, caused by humans) warming trend presently escalating, is
recognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss and the expansion
of disease organisms. Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from
15 percent to 40 percent of species destined for extinction by 2050. Scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter
regional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them, in
particular, the endemic species. The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species
to move with their adapted climate norms while facing habitat gaps along the way. The shifting ranges will impose new
competitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range. One
such unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears. Previously, these two distinct species had separate
ranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable
offspring, which may or may not be viable crossing back to either parental species. Changing climates also throw off species’
delicate timed adaptations to seasonal food resources and breeding times. Many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource
availability and timing have already been documented.

Preserving Biodiversity
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Identify new technologies and methods for describing biodiversity
• Explain the legislative framework for conservation
• Describe principles and challenges of conservation preserve design
• Identify examples of the effects of habitat restoration
• Discuss the role of zoos in biodiversity conservation
Preserving biodiversity is an extraordinary challenge that must be met by greater understanding of biodiversity itself, changes
in human behavior and beliefs, and various preservation strategies.
Measuring Biodiversity
The technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planet’s
species in an accessible way is now feasible.DNA barcodingis one molecular genetic method, which takes advantage of rapid
evolution in a mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase 1) present in eukaryotes, except for plants, to identify species using the
sequence of portions of the gene. However, plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes. Rapid mass
sequencing machines make the molecular genetics portion of the work relatively inexpensive and quick. Computer resources
store and make available the large volumes of data. Projects are currently underway to use DNA barcoding to catalog museum
specimens, which have already been named and studied, as well as testing the method on less-studied groups. As of mid 2017,
close to 200,000 named species had been barcoded. Early studies suggest there are significant numbers of undescribed species
that looked too much like sibling species to previously be recognized as different. These now can be identified with DNA
barcoding.
Numerous computer databases now provide information about named species and a framework for adding new species.
However, as already noted, at the present rate of description of new species, it will take close to 500 years before the complete
catalog of life is known. Many, perhaps most, species on the planet do not have that much time.
There is also the problem of understanding which species known to science are threatened and to what degree they are
threatened. This task is carried out by the non-profitIUCNwhich, as previously mentioned, maintains the Red List—an online
listing of endangered species categorized by taxonomy, type of threat, and other criteria (Figure 47.16). The Red List is supported
by scientific research. In 2011, the list contained 61,000 species, all with supporting documentation.

all threatened species will be properly protected, either the protected areas must increase in size, or the percentage of high
quality preserves must increase, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection. Researchers
indicate that more attention to the latter solution is required.
Preserve Design
There has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The fundamental principle behind
much of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson published in 1967 on
island biogeography.5This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands. The fundamental conclusion
was that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration, speciation, and extinction on that
island. Islands farther from a mainland are harder to get to, so migration is lower and the equilibrium number of species is
lower. Within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually increases to a level similar to the
numbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated. In addition, smaller islands are harder to find,
so their immigration rates for new species are typically lower. Smaller islands are also less geographically diverse so all things
being equal, there are fewer niches to promote speciation. And finally, smaller islands support smaller populations, so the
probability of extinction is higher.
As islands get larger, the number of species able to colonize the island and find suitable niches on the island increases, although
the effect of island area on species numbers is not a direct correlation. Conservation preserves can be seen as “islands” of habitat
within “an ocean” of non-habitat. For a species to persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough to support it. The
critical size depends, in part, on the home range that is characteristic of the species. A preserve for wolves, which range
hundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a preserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its
lifetime. But larger preserves have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support
more species, and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily.
Preserves perform better when there arebuffer zonesaround them of suboptimal habitat. The buffer allows organisms to exit
the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources. One large
preserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges. For
this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin “arms.” If preserves
must be smaller, then providingwildlife corridorsbetween them so that individuals (and their genes) can move between the
preserves, for example along rivers and streams, will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one. All of these
factors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.
In addition to the physical, biological, and ecological specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of policy, legislative, and
enforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection of species. These can include
anything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive human
recreation. Many of these policy decisions are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations. In
some cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations have been forced from
ancestral lands that fell within a preserve. In other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are
not or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction. This
is a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics.
Limitations on Preserves
Some of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. Political and
economic pressures typically make preserves smaller, rather than larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult.
If the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve. In this case, an
area on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve.
Enforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and
illegal resource extraction.
Climate change will create inevitable problems with thelocationof preserves. The species within them may migrate to higher
latitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable. Scientists are planning for the effects of global warming on future
preserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to habitats; however, the end
effectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based.

replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value of free-flowing rivers and because many dams no longer
provide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first built. The measured benefits of dam removal include
restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams is frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which
leads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality. In the Pacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to
increase populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems
during its annual spawning migrations. In other regions such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of
spawninganadromous fish species(species that are born in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh
water to spawn). Some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences
to be measured. The large-scale ecological experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for
other dam projects slated either for removal or construction.
The Role of Captive Breeding
Zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education. The
transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to
conservation is ongoing and gaining strength. In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases,
captive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced
to the wild. However, captive breeding programs have yielded some success stories, such as the American condor reintroduction
to the Grand Canyon and the reestablishment of the Whooping Crane along the Midwest flyway.
Unfortunately, zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are
now at risk. Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend to
urbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. A number of studies have been performed
to look at the effectiveness of zoos on people’s attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results tend to be
mixed.
