Ahypothesisis a suggested explanation for an event, which one can test.\nAlthough using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because it is\nrelatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like\narchaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as repeating experiments becomes more\ndifficult.\nThese areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archaeology\u2014even though one cannot perform repeatable\nexperiments, hypotheses may still be supported. For instance, an archaeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed\nbased on finding a piece of pottery. He or she could make further hypotheses about various characteristics of this culture, which\ncould be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified\ntheory. Atheoryis a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Therefore, we may be better off to define\nscience as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.\nNatural Sciences\nWhat would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the brain\nfunctions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy,\nbiology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure 1.4). However, scientists consider those\nfields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processesnatural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural\nsciences might contain any of the items listed above.\nFigure1.4The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, mathematics,\nand many other fields. (credit: \u201cImage Editor\u201d/Flickr)\nThere is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. For some experts, the\nnatural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences\nintolife sciences, which study living things and include biology, andphysical sciences, which study nonliving matter and\ninclude astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life\nand physical sciences and are interdisciplinary.

(credit: Paul van Somer)\nThe scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to solve) that leads to a question. Let\u2019s think about a\nsimple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a\nstudent arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a\nproblem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: \u201cWhy is the classroom so warm?\u201d\nProposing a Hypothesis\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that one can test. To solve a problem, one can propose several hypotheses. For\nexample, one hypothesis might be, \u201cThe classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.\u201d However, there\ncould be other responses to the question, and therefore one may propose other hypotheses. A second hypothesis might be, \u201cThe\nclassroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nOnce one has selected a hypothesis, the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has\nthe format \u201cIf . . . then . . . .\u201d For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, \u201cIfthe student turns on the air\nconditioning,thenthe classroom will no longer be too warm.\u201d\nTesting a Hypothesis\nA valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also befalsifiable, meaning that experimental results can disprove it. Importantly,\nscience does not claim to \u201cprove\u201d anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further\ninformation. This step\u2014openness to disproving ideas\u2014is what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. The presence of the\nsupernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more\nexperiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or\nmore controls. Avariableis any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. Thecontrol group\ncontains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that the researcher hypothesizes.\nTherefore, if the experimental group's results differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized\nmanipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow. To test the first\nhypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there\nshould be another reason, and the student should reject this hypothesis. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check\nif the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and the student should reject this hypothesis. The\nstudents should test each hypothesis by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not\ndetermine whether or not one can accept the other hypotheses. It simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (Figure 1.6).\nUsing the scientific method, the student rejects the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data.\nWhile this \u201cwarm classroom\u201d example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer\ncontrols. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. One\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n12",

Researchers have studied other less complex organisms as part of\nthis project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on\nbasic research with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the\ndata for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.\nFigure1.9The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different science fields.\nResearchers completed the project, which sequenced the entire human genome, in 2003. (credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome\nPrograms (http://genomics.energy.gov(http://openstax.org/l/genomics_gov))\nWhile scientists usually carefully plan research efforts in both basic science and applied science, note that some discoveries are\nmade byserendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming\ndiscovered penicillin when he accidentally left a petri dish ofStaphylococcusbacteria open. An unwanted mold grew on the dish,\nkilling the bacteria. Fleming's curiosity to investigate the reason behind the bacterial death, followed by his experiments, led to\nthe discovery of the antibiotic penicillin, which is produced by the fungusPenicillium. Even in the highly organized world of\nscience, luck\u2014when combined with an observant, curious mind\u2014can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.\nReporting Scientific Work\nWhether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers\nto expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists\u2014when planning, conducting, and analyzing\nresults\u2014are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist\u2019s work are communicating\nwith peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or\nconference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in\npeer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals.Peer-reviewed manuscriptsare scientific papers that a\nscientist\u2019s colleagues or peers review. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who\njudge whether or not the scientist\u2019s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research\nin a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for\nresearch funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their\nexperiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with\nthe findings of other scientists.\nA scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed\nguidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate. A\nscientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.\nThe scientific paper consists of several specific sections\u2014introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. This\nstructure is sometimes called the \u201cIMRaD\u201d format. There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an\nabstract(a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n16",

Biologists may pursue one of those\nsubdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance,molecular biologyandbiochemistrystudy biological processes at\nthe molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way\nthey are regulated.Microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled\norganisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists,\necologists, and geneticists, among others.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nForensic Scientist\nForensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists and\nbiochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves\nexamining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly\nbecause of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, developing molecular techniques and\nestablishing DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily\nrelated to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood,\nand other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.19) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic\nscientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to\npursue careers in forensic science will most likely have to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math\ncourses.\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n24",

Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the\nnucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.\nProtons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 \u00d7 10-24grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of\nmass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, asTable 2.2shows. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in\ntheir electric charge. Aprotonis positively charged; whereas, aneutronis uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an\natom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge.Electronsare much smaller in mass than protons, weighing\nonly 9.11 \u00d7 10-28grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element\u2019s overall\natomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the\natom\u2019s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do\ncontribute greatly to the atom\u2019s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the proton's positive charge. In\nuncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In\nthese atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.\nAccounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the atom's volume\u2014greater than 99 percent\u2014is empty\nspace. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they\ndo not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.\nProtons, Neutrons, and Electrons\nCharge Mass (amu) Location\nProton +1 1 nucleus\nNeutron 0 1 nucleus\nElectron \u20131 0 orbitals\nTable2.2\nAtomic Number and Mass\nAtoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an\nelement\u2019satomic number, which scientists use to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable,\nresulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess.\nTogether, the number of protons and neutrons determine an element\u2019smass number, asFigure 2.3illustrates. Note that we\ndisregard the small contribution of mass from electrons in calculating the mass number. We can use this approximation of mass\nto easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number.\nSince an element\u2019s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine theatomic mass, which is the\ncalculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For\nexample, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with\natomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n32",

The properties of\nelements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. Elements also have\nspecificchemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.\nIn the periodic table inFigure 2.5, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged\nin a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties.

An electron normally exists in\nthe lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy\nshell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, it releases a photon of light.\nElectrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of\nincreasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they fill with one electron in each\nenergy level before adding a second electron. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the atom's energetic stability\nand its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.\nUnder standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost\nshell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight\nelectrons. This is known as theoctet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable\nenergetically when they have eight electrons in theirvalence shell, the outermost electron shell.Figure 2.7shows examples of\nsome neutral atoms and their electron configurations.

Within each electron shell are subshells, and each\nsubshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly an electron's location,\nscientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. The letter s,p,d, andfdesignate the subshells. Thes\nsubshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a singlesorbital, which can hold two electrons.\nPrincipal shell 2n has onesand onepsubshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. Thepsubshell has three dumbbell-shaped\norbitals, asFigure 2.8illustrates.

Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals in the\nenergy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, we can determine the electron structure by\nfitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.\nFigure2.8Thessubshells are shaped like spheres. Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have ansorbital, but the size of the sphere is larger\nin the 2n orbital. Each sphere is a single orbital. Three dumbbell-shaped orbitals comprisepsubshells. Principal shell 2n has apsubshell,\nbut shell 1 does not.\nThe closest orbital to the nucleus, the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the Bohr model's\ninnermost electron shell. Scientists call it the 1sorbital because it is spherical around the nucleus. The 1sorbital is the closest\norbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital fills. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it occupies\nonly one spot within the 1sorbital. We designate this as 1s1, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s\norbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1sorbital with its two electrons. We designate this as 1s2,\nreferring to the two electrons of helium in the 1sorbital. On the periodic tableFigure 2.5, hydrogen and helium are the only two\nelements in the first row (period). This is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1sorbital. Hydrogen and helium\nare the only two elements that have the 1sand no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.\nThe second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another sphericalsorbital and three \u201cdumbbell\u201d\nshapedporbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, asFigure 2.8shows. After the 1sorbital fills, the second electron shell\nfills, first filling its 2sorbital and then its threeporbitals. When filling theporbitals, each takes a single electron. Once eachp\norbital has an electron, it may add a second. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells. Two\nelectrons fill the 1sorbital, and the third electron then fills the 2sorbital. Itselectron configurationis 1s22s1. Neon (Ne),\nalternatively, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1sorbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2sand\nthreeporbitals). Thus it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other\natoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, comprising the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and\norbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of an atom's electron configuration because the orbital\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n38",

The equations\nthat describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and areirreversible.Reversible reactionsare those that can go in\neither direction. In reversible reactions, reactants turn into products, but when the product's concentration goes beyond a\ncertain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products convert back into reactants. At this point,\nproduct and reactant designations reverse. This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and\nproducts occurs\u2014a state calledequilibrium. A chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the\nreactants and products often denote these reversible reaction situations.\nFor example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H+) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO-) forming an equilibrium state with\n3\ncarbonic acid (H CO). If we added carbonic acid to this system, some of it would convert to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.\n2 3\nHowever, biological reactions rarely obtain equilibrium because the concentrations of the reactants or products or both are\nconstantly changing, often with one reaction's product a reactant for another. To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions\nin the blood, forming carbonic acid will be the reaction's major direction. However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as\ncarbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of converting back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the\nlaw of mass action. These reactions are important for maintaining homeostasis in our blood.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nSome atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost\nelectron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of\nprotons, each ion has a net charge.Cationsare positive ions that form by losing electrons. Negative ions form by gaining\nelectrons, which we call anions. We designateanionsby their elemental name and change the ending to \u201c-ide\u201d, thus the anion of\nchlorine is chloride, and the anion of sulfur is sulfide.\nScientists refer to this movement of electrons from one element to another aselectron transfer. AsFigure 2.11illustrates,\nsodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it\ndoes to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell.

The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two\nelectrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent\nmolecule.\nFigure2.12Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and carbon dioxide have\npolar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.\nHydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions\nIonic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break. Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines\ntheir behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between\nmolecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types\nof bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water\nand also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.\nWhen polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because\nhydrogen\u2019s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is\nslightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the\nhydrogen's\u03b4+from one molecule and the molecule's\u03b4\u2013charge on another molecule with the more electronegative atoms,\nusually oxygen. Scientists call this interaction ahydrogen bond. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between\nwater molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and\nin organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA\ndouble helix.\nLike hydrogen bonds,van der Waals interactionsare weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals\nattractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities,\nwhich are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one\nanother. These bonds\u2014along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds\u2014contribute to the proteins' three-dimensional structure\nin our cells that is necessary for their proper function.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nPharmaceutical Chemist\nPharmaceutical chemists are responsible for developing new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and\nnew drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process. We can find drugs in the natural environment or we\ncan synthesize them in the laboratory. In many cases, chemists chemically change potential drugs from nature chemically in the\nlaboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version we find\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n42",

As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but forms droplets instead.\nThis is because it is a nonpolar compound. (credit: Gautam Dogra).\nWater\u2019s States: Gas, Liquid, and Solid\nThe formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. As water\nmolecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other\nliquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. In\nliquid water, hydrogen bonds constantly form and break as the water molecules slide past each other. The water molecules'\nmotion (kinetic energy) causes the bonds to break due to the heat contained in the system. When the heat rises as water boils,\nthe water molecules' higher kinetic energy causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape\ninto the air as gas (steam or water vapor). Alternatively, when water temperature reduces and water freezes, the water molecules\nform a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that\nmakes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon that we do not see when other liquids solidify.\nWater\u2019s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds orient as they freeze: the water molecules push farther\napart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes lowering kinetic\nenergy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density\nthan the liquid.\nThe lower density of ice, asFigure 2.14depicts, an anomaly causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg\nor ice cubes in a glass of water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the water's surface creating an insulating barrier that\nprotects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this insulating ice layer, plants and animals living in the\npond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The expansion of ice relative to liquid water causes the\ndetrimental effect of freezing on living organisms. The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes\nessential for living cells to function, irreversibly damaging them. Cells can only survive freezing if another liquid like glycerol\ntemporarily replaces the water in them.\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n44",

Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and\nform ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when we add NaCl crystals to water, the NaCl molecules dissociate\ninto Na+and Cl\u2013ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, asFigure 2.15illustrates. The partially negative charge of\nthe water molecule\u2019s oxygen surrounds the positively charged sodium ion. The hydrogen's partially positive charge on the water\nmolecule surrounds the negatively charged chloride ion.\nFigure2.15When we mix table salt (NaCl) in water, it forms spheres of hydration around the ions.\nWater\u2019s Cohesive and Adhesive Properties\nHave you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the water forms\na dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property ofcohesion. In\ncohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the\nliquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.\nCohesion allows forsurface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupturing when placed under tension or stress.\nThis is also why water forms droplets when on a dry surface rather than flattening by gravity. When we place a small scrap of\npaper onto a water droplet, the paper floats on top even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface\ntension keep the water molecules' hydrogen bonds intact and support the item floating on the top. It\u2019s even possible to \u201cfloat\u201d a\nneedle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently without breaking the surface tension, asFigure 2.16shows.\nFigure2.16A needle's weight pulls the surface downward. At the same time, the surface tension pulls it up, suspending it on the water's\nsurface preventing it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around the needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nThese cohesive forces are related to water\u2019s property ofadhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other\nmolecules. This attraction is sometimes stronger than water\u2019s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged\nsurfaces such as those on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. We observe adhesion when water \u201cclimbs\u201d up\nthe tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the tube's sides than in the middle. This is\nbecause the water molecules are attracted to the capillary's charged glass walls more than they are to each other and therefore\nadhere to it. We call this type of adhesioncapillary action, asFigure 2.17illustrates.\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n46",

The pH\ninside of human cells and blood are examples of two body areas where near-neutral pH is maintained.\nNon-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive\nintegers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number; whereas, low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH.\nAnacidis a substance that increases hydrogen ions' (H+) concentration in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen\natoms dissociate. Abaseprovides either hydroxide ions (OH\u2013) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen\nions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions,\nthese ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.\nThe stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+.

The macromolecules are a subset oforganic molecules(any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are\nespecially important for life. The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. The carbon atom has\nunique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to\nserve as the basic structural component, or \u201cbackbone,\u201d of the macromolecules.\nIndividual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six\nprotons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. Therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four\ncovalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. The methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical\nformula CH . Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons.\n4\nThis results in a filled outermost shell.\nHydrocarbons\nHydrocarbonsare organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH ) described above. We\n4\noften use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels\u2014like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many covalent\nbonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which releases when these molecules burn (oxidize).\nMethane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen\natoms, asFigure 2.21illustrates. The shape of its electron orbitals determines the shape of the methane molecule's geometry,\nwhere the atoms reside in three dimensions. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a tetrahedron, with four triangular\nfaces. For this reason, we describe methane as having tetrahedral geometry.\nFigure2.21Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5\u00b0 apart.\nAs the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or\ncombinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and\neach type of bond affects the molecule's geometry in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large\nmolecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.\nHydrocarbon Chains\nSuccessive bonds between carbon atoms form hydrocarbon chains. These may be branched or unbranched. Furthermore, a\nmolecule's different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds alter the overall molecule's geometry asFigure 2.22\nillustrates. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the\nmolecule's geometry. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix \u201ceth-,\u201d which is the prefix for two carbon\nhydrocarbons. The suffixes \u201c-ane,\u201d \u201c-ene,\u201d and \u201c-yne\u201d refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds,\nrespectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butene, and\nbutyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the molecule's geometry: single bonds allow\nrotation along the bond's axis; whereas, double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one.

These groups play an\nimportant role in forming molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. We usually classify functional groups as\nhydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An example of a hydrophobic group is the\nnonpolar methyl molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group in amino acids, some amino acid side\nchains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids. This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H+)\nfrom the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO-group.

To lose\nweight, some individuals adhere to \u201clow-carb\u201d diets. Athletes, in contrast, often \u201ccarb-load\u201d before important competitions to\nensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet. Grains,\nfruits, and vegetables are all natural carbohydrate sources that provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple\nsugar that is a component ofstarchand an ingredient in many staple foods. Carbohydrates also have other important functions\nin humans, animals, and plants.\nMolecular Structures\nThe stoichiometric formula (CH O) , wherenis the number of carbons in the molecule representscarbohydrates. In other\n2 n\nwords, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula also explains the origin of the\nterm \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d: the components are carbon (\u201ccarbo\u201d) and the components of water (hence, \u201chydrate\u201d). Scientists classify\ncarbohydrates into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\nMonosaccharides\nMonosaccharides(mono- = \u201cone\u201d; sacchar- = \u201csweet\u201d) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In\nmonosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix\n-ose. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is an aldose, and if it has a ketone\ngroup (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R'), it is a ketose. Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they\ncan be trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and/or hexoses (six carbons).Figure 3.4illustrates monosaccharides.\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n62",

For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to\nmanage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing\nhomes, schools, and private practices.\nTo become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a\nrelated field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass a national exam. Those\nwho pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human\nphysiology. Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins,\ncarbohydrates, and fats).\nBenefits of Carbohydrates\nAre carbohydrates good for you?

What distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in a protein embedded in a lipid bilayer?\nThe chemical nature of the side chain determines the amino acid's nature (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).\nFor example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine\nare nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic\nside chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also basic amino\nacids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure.

For example, the letter V or the three-letter\nsymbol val represent valine. Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids also are necessary. These essential\namino acids in humans include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential amino acids refer to those necessary to build proteins\nin the body, but not those that the body produces. Which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.\nThe sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein's shape, size, and function. A covalent bond, or\npeptide bond, attaches to each amino acid, which a dehydration reaction forms.

For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has\ntwo polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is\nglycine; whereas, the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.25). The amino acid sequences in the A and B chains are\nunique to insulin.\nFigure3.25Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone comprised of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30 amino acids\nlong). In each chain, three-letter abbreviations that represent the amino acids' names in the order they are present indicate primary\nstructure. The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of\noxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond. Two disulfide bonds connect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the\ncorrect shape. Note that all disulfide bonds are the same length, but we have drawn them different sizes for clarity.\nThe gene encoding the protein ultimately determines the unique sequence for every protein. A change in nucleotide sequence of\nthe gene\u2019s coding region may lead to adding a different amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in\nprotein structure and function.

The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The\nstructural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule\u2014which dramatically decreases life\nexpectancy\u2014is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more remarkable is that three nucleotides each encode those 600\namino acids, and a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases causes the mutation.\nFigure3.26The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to sickle cell anemia. In\nnormal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate. In sickle cell hemoglobin, a valine replaces glutamate.\nBecause of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or\ndisc-shaped, red blood cells and causes them to assume a crescent or \u201csickle\u201d shape, which clogs blood vessels (Figure 3.27).

Primarily, the interactions among R groups create the protein's complex\nthree-dimensional tertiary structure. The nature of the R groups in the amino acids involved can counteract forming the\nhydrogen bonds we described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups with like charges repel each other and\nthose with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When protein folding takes place, the nonpolar amino acids'\nhydrophobic R groups lie in the protein's interior; whereas, the hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside. Scientists also call the\nformer interaction types hydrophobic interactions. Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the\npresence of oxygen, the only covalent bond that forms during protein folding.\nFigure3.29A variety of chemical interactions determine the proteins' tertiary structure. These include hydrophobic interactions, ionic\nbonding, hydrogen bonding, and disulfide linkages.\nAll of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the protein's final three-dimensional shape. When a protein loses its\nthree-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.\nQuaternary Structure\nIn nature, some proteins form from several polypeptides, or subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the\nquaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For example, insulin (a\nglobular protein) has a combination of hydrogen and disulfide bonds that cause it to mostly clump into a ball shape.

They carry the cell's genetic blueprint and carry\ninstructions for its functioning.\nDNA and RNA\nThe two main types of nucleic acids aredeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)andribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the genetic material in\nall living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the\norganelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.\nThe cell's entire genetic content is its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes,\nDNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may\ncontain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products. Other genes code for RNA\nproducts. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes \u201con\u201d or \u201coff.\u201d\nThe other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but\ninstead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is themessenger RNA (mRNA). Other\ntypes of RNA\u2014like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA\u2014are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.\nDNA and RNA are comprised of monomers that scientists callnucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a\npolynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Three components comprise each nucleotide: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar,\nand a phosphate group (Figure 3.31). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to\none or more phosphate groups.\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n86",

The difference between the sugars is the\npresence of the hydroxyl group on the ribose's second carbon and hydrogen on the deoxyribose's second carbon. The carbon\natoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1\u2032, 2\u2032, 3\u2032, 4\u2032, and 5\u2032 (1\u2032 is read as \u201cone prime\u201d). The phosphate residue attaches to the\nhydroxyl group of the 5\u2032 carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3\u2032 carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which\nforms a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032phosphodiesterlinkage. A simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in\nmacromolecules does not form the phosphodiester linkage. Its formation involves removing two phosphate groups. A\npolynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.\nDNA Double-Helix Structure\nDNA has a double-helix structure (Figure 3.32). The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the DNA's\nbackbone. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like a pair of staircase steps. Hydrogen bonds bind the pairs to each\nother. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. The helix's two strands run in opposite\ndirections, meaning that the 5\u2032 carbon end of one strand will face the 3\u2032 carbon end of its matching strand. (Scientists call this an\nantiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.)\nFigure3.32Native DNA is an antiparallel double helix. The phosphate backbone (indicated by the curvy lines) is on the outside, and the\nbases are on the inside. Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base from the opposing strand. (credit: Jerome\nWalker/Dennis Myts)\nOnly certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This means\nA can pair with T, and G can pair with C, asFigure 3.33shows. This is the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA\nstrands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have\nthe sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand copies itself, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix\ncontaining one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n88",

Prokaryotic DNA is in the cell's central\npart: thenucleoid(Figure 4.5).\nFigure4.5This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell. All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid,\nribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall. The other structures shown are present in some, but not all, bacteria.\nMost prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5). The cell wall acts as an\nextra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to\nsurfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion. Pili exchange\ngenetic material during conjugation, the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another through direct\ncontact. Bacteria use fimbriae to attach to a host cell.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nMicrobiologist\nThe most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or her hands. Why?\nBecause microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are ubiquitous. They live on doorknobs,\nmoney, your hands, and many other surfaces. If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you\ntouch that same doorknob, the microbes from the sneezer\u2019s mucus are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your\nmouth, nose, or eyes, those microbes can enter your body and could make you sick.\nHowever, not all microbes (also called microorganisms) cause disease; most are actually beneficial. You have microbes in your\ngut that make vitamin K. Other microorganisms are used to ferment beer and wine.\nMicrobiologists are scientists who study microbes. Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers. Not only do they work in the\nfood industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can work in the pharmaceutical sector, serving\nkey roles in research and development by identifying new antibiotic sources that can treat bacterial infections.\nEnvironmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered microbes to remove\npollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from contaminated sites. We call using these microbes\nbioremediation technologies. Microbiologists can also work in the bioinformatics field, providing specialized knowledge and\ninsight for designing, developing, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics.\nCell Size\nAt 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from\n10 to 100 \u03bcm (Figure 4.6). The prokaryotes' small size allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to\nother parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse. This is not the case in\neukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n100",

During protein synthesis, ribosomes assemble amino\nacids into proteins.\nBecause protein synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural\ncomponents, and surface receptors), there are ribosomes in practically every cell.

This is thecell wall,\na rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal and some protistan cells\nalso have cell walls. While the prokaryotic cell walls' chief component is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant\n(and some protists') cell wall is cellulose (Figure 4.16), a polysaccharide comprised of glucose units. Have you ever noticed that\nwhen you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches? That\u2019s because you are tearing the celery cells' rigid cell walls with\nyour teeth.\nFigure4.16Cellulose is a long chain of \u03b2-glucose molecules connected by a 1-4 linkage. The dashed lines at each end of the figure indicate\na series of many more glucose units. The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an entire cellulose molecule.\nChloroplasts\nLike the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function.\nChloroplastsare plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon\ndioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. This is a major difference between plants and animals. Plants\n(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars used in cellular respiration to provide ATP energy generated in the\nplant mitochondria. Animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.\nLike mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast\u2019s inner\nmembrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs we call thylakoids (Figure 4.17). Each thylakoid\nstack is a granum (plural = grana). We call the fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana the stroma.\nFigure4.17The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures - thylakoids that are stacked into\ngrana. We call the space inside the thylakoid membranes the thylakoid space. The light harvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid\nmembranes, and sugar synthesis takes place in the fluid inside the inner membrane, which we call the stroma. Chloroplasts also have their\nown genome, which is contained on a single circular chromosome.\nThe chloroplasts contain a green pigment,chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of\nphotosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but their\nchlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n108",

Collectively, scientists call this network of protein fibers thecytoskeleton.

You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and\nthe skin's epidermis.\nMicrotubules\nAs their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. Polymerized dimers of \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin, two globular\nproteins, comprise the microtubule's walls (Figure 4.25). With a diameter of about 25 nm,microtubulesare cytoskeletons'\nwidest components. They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull\nreplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. Like microfilaments, microtubules can disassemble and reform\nquickly.\nFigure4.25Microtubules are hollow. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin (right image). The left image\nshows the tube's molecular structure.\nMicrotubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the centrosome's two perpendicular\nbodies). In animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite\ndifferent structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as we discuss below.\nFlagella and Cilia\nTheflagella(singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and enable an entire cell\nto move (for example, sperm,Euglena, and some prokaryotes). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella.\nHowever, whencilia(singular = cilium) are present, many of them extend along the plasma membrane's entire surface. They are\nshort, hair-like structures that move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the cell's outer surface (for example, the\ncilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that\ntrap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)\nDespite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called\na \u201c9 + 2 array.\u201d This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets,\nsurrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26).\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n116",

The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain\ncells, such as red and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are\nthe more obvious plasma membrane functions. In addition, the plasma membrane's surface carries markers\nthat allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital for tissue and organ formation during early\ndevelopment, and which later plays a role in the immune response's \u201cself\u201d versus \u201cnon-self\u201d distinction.\nAmong the most sophisticated plasma membrane functions is the ability for complex, integral proteins,\nreceptors to transmit signals. These proteins act both as extracellular input receivers and as intracellular\nprocessing activators. These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like\nhormones and growth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are\nbound. Occasionally, viruses hijack receptors (HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, is one example) that\nuse them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated, causing the\nsignal transduction process to malfunction with disastrous consequences.\nFluid Mosaic Model\nScientists identified the plasma membrane in the 1890s, and its chemical components in 1915. The principal\ncomponents they identified were lipids and proteins. In 1935, Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed the\nplasma membrane's structure. This was the first model that others in the scientific community widely\naccepted. It was based on the plasma membrane's \u201crailroad track\u201d appearance in early electron micrographs.\nDavson and Danielli theorized that the plasma membrane's structure resembles a sandwich. They made the\nanalogy of proteins to bread, and lipids to the filling. In the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the plasma membrane's core\nconsisted of a double, rather than a single, layer. In 1972, S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new\nmodel that provides microscopic observations and better explains plasma membrane function.\nThe explanation, thefluid mosaic model, has evolved somewhat over time, but it still best accounts for\nplasma membrane structure and function as we now understand them.

Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the membrane's\noutward-facing surface.\nA plasma membrane's principal components are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates attached to\nsome of the lipids and proteins. A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked\nhead group. Cholesterol, another lipid comprised of four fused carbon rings, is situated alongside the phospholipids in the\nmembrane's core. The protein, lipid, and carbohydrate proportions in the plasma membrane vary with cell type, but for a typical\nhuman cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids (of all types) account for about 40 percent,\nand carbohydrates comprise the remaining 10 percent. However, protein and lipid concentration varies with different cell\nmembranes. For example, myelin, an outgrowth of specialized cells' membrane that insulates the peripheral nerves' axons,\ncontains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and only\n24 percent lipid. The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. Carbohydrates are present only on the\nplasma membrane's exterior surface and are attached to proteins, formingglycoproteins, or attached to lipids, forming\nglycolipids.\nPhospholipids\nThe membrane's main fabric comprises amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules. Thehydrophilicor \u201cwater-loving\u201d areas of these\nmolecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist\u2019s rendition of the model) (Figure 5.2) are in contact with the aqueous\nfluid both inside and outside the cell.Hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar. They interact with other\nnon-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules. When placed in water,\nhydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The phospholipids' hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with water\nand other polar molecules on both the cell's exterior and interior. Thus, the membrane surfaces that face the cell's interior and\nexterior are hydrophilic. In contrast, the cell membrane's interior is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Therefore,\nphospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside the cell.\nA phospholipid molecule (Figure 5.3) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached to\ncarbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon. This arrangement gives the overall molecule a\nhead area (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge, and a tail area (the fatty acids),\nwhich has no charge. The head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot. Scientists call a molecule with a positively or\nnegatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, areaamphiphilicor \u201cdual-loving.\u201d\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n130",

(credit: modification of work by NIH, NIAID)\nMembrane Fluidity\nThe membrane's mosaic characteristic helps to illustrate its nature. The integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as\nseparate but loosely attached molecules. These resemble the separate, multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float,\nmoving somewhat with respect to one another. The membrane is not like a balloon, however, that can expand and contract;\nrather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in too much water. However, because of its mosaic nature, a\nvery fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal\nwhen one extracts the needle.\nThe membrane's mosaic characteristics explain some but not all of its fluidity. There are two other factors that help maintain this\nfluid characteristic. One factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves. In their saturated form, the fatty acids in\nphospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. There are no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. This\nresults in tails that are relatively straight. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number of hydrogen\natoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. A double bond results in a bend in the carbon\nstring of approximately 30 degrees (Figure 5.3).\nThus, if decreasing temperatures compress saturated fatty acids with their straight tails, they press in on each other, making a\ndense and fairly rigid membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the \u201ckinks\u201d in their tails elbow adjacent\nphospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This \u201celbow room\u201d helps to\nmaintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids\nwould \u201cfreeze\u201d or solidify. The membrane's relative fluidity is particularly important in a cold environment. A cold environment\nusually compresses membranes comprised largely of saturated fatty acids, making them less fluid and more susceptible to\nrupturing. Many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold environments by changing the proportion of\nunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to lower temperature.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit thissite(http://openstax.org/l/biological_memb)to see animations of the membranes' fluidity and mosaic quality.\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n134",

In other words, plasma membranes areselectively permeable\u2014they allow some\nsubstances to pass through, but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself,\nand it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances. They must have a way of obtaining these\nmaterials from extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have\nspecial mechanisms that facilitate transport. Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy,\nhydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials. Red blood cells use some of their energy doing just that.\nMost cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions between the cell's interior\nand exterior, as well as on protein synthesis.\nThe most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.Passive transportis a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not\nrequire the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of\nhigher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A physical space in which there is a single substance concentration\nrange has aconcentration gradient.\nSelective Permeability\nPlasma membranes are asymmetric: the membrane's interior is not identical to its exterior. There is a considerable difference\nbetween the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a membrane. On the membrane's interior,\nsome proteins serve to anchor the membrane to cytoskeleton's fibers. There are peripheral proteins on the membrane's exterior\nthat bind extracellular matrix elements. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also on the plasma membrane's\nexterior surface. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind required substances in the extracellular fluid. This adds\nconsiderably to plasma membrane's selective nature (Figure 5.7).\nFigure5.7The plasma membrane's exterior surface is not identical to its interior surface.\nRecall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic: They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps move\nsome materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Non-polar and lipid-soluble material with a low\nmolecular weight can easily slip through the membrane's hydrophobic lipid core. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A,\nD, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs and\nhormones also gain easy entry into cells and readily transport themselves into the body\u2019s tissues and organs. Oxygen and carbon\n\n--- Page 156 ---\n136",

(credit: Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nA doctor injects a patient with what the doctor thinks is an isotonic saline solution. The patient dies, and an autopsy reveals that\nmany red blood cells have been destroyed. Do you think the solution the doctor injected was really isotonic?\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor a video illustrating the diffusion process in solutions, visit thissite(http://openstax.org/l/dispersion).\nTonicity in Living Systems\nIn a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. In an isotonic condition, the relative solute and solvent\nconcentrations are equal on both membrane sides. There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change in the cell's\nsize. In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. If either the hypo- or hyper- condition goes to excess, the\ncell\u2019s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.\nA red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane\u2019s capability to expand. Remember, the\nmembrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules comprising it. If the cell swells, and the spaces\nbetween the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.\nIn contrast, when excessive water amounts leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. This has the effect of\nconcentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. The cell\u2019s\nability to function will be compromised and may also result in the cell's death.\nVarious living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis\u2014a mechanism we call osmoregulation. Some organisms,\nsuch as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent cell lysis in a\nhypotonic solution. The plasma membrane can only expand to the cell wall's limit, so the cell will not lyse. The cytoplasm in\nplants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available. This water\ninflow produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the plant's cell walls (Figure 5.13). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports\nthe plant. Conversly, if you do not water the plant, the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell.\nIn this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible. However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall\nand constricts the cytoplasm. We call thisplasmolysis. Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 5.14).\n\n--- Page 162 ---\n142",

Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells\ncontain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a\ndifference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the\nextracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+) and lower\nconcentrations of sodium (Na+) than the extracellular fluid. Thus in a living cell, the concentration gradient of Na+tends to drive\nit into the cell, and its electrical gradient (a positive ion) also drives it inward to the negatively charged interior. However, the\nsituation is more complex for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K+, a positive ion, also drives it into\nthe cell, but the concentration gradient of K+drives K+outof the cell (Figure 5.16).

The sugar (glucose) is\nstored as starch or glycogen. Energy-storing polymers like these break down into glucose to supply ATP molecules.\nSolar energy is required to synthesize a glucose molecule during the photosynthesis reactions. In photosynthesis, light energy\nfrom the sun initially transforms into chemical energy that temporally stores itself in the energy carrier molecules ATP and\nNADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Photosynthesis later uses the stored energy in ATP and NADPH to\nbuild one glucose molecule from six molecules of CO . This process is analogous to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire\n2\nenergy for your body that you can use later in the day. Under ideal conditions, energy from 18 molecules of ATP is required to\nsynthesize one glucose molecule during photosynthesis reactions. Glucose molecules can also combine with and convert into\nother sugar types. When an organism consumes sugars, glucose molecules eventually make their way into each organism's living\ncell. Inside the cell, each sugar molecule breaks down through a complex series of chemical reactions. The goal of these reactions\nis to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar molecules. The harvested energy makes high-energy ATP molecules, which\nperform work, powering many chemical reactions in the cell. The amount of energy needed to make one glucose molecule from\nsix carbon dioxide molecules is 18 ATP molecules and 12 NADPH molecules (each one of which is energetically equivalent to\nthree ATP molecules), or a total of 54 molecule equivalents required for synthesizing one glucose molecule. This process is a\nfundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.\nFigure6.3Plants, like this oak tree and acorn, use energy from sunlight to make sugar and other organic molecules. Both plants and\nanimals (like this squirrel) use cellular respiration to derive energy from the organic molecules that plants originally produced.

A metabolic pathway is\na series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step, through a series\nof metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products. In the case of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic\npathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. Scientists\ncall these two opposite processes\u2014the first requiring energy and the second producing energy\u2014anabolic (building) and\ncatabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively.

How can we compare the energy that releases from\none reaction to that of another reaction? We use a measurement offree energyto quantitate these energy transfers. Scientists\ncall this free energy Gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist who developed the\nmeasurement. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve losing some energy in an\nunusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. Gibbs free energy specifically refers to the energy that takes place with a\nchemical reaction that is available after we account for entropy. In other words, Gibbs free energy is usable energy, or energy\nthat is available to do work.\nEvery chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta G (\u2206G). We can calculate the change in free energy for any\nsystem that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction. To calculate \u2206G, subtract the amount of energy lost to\nentropy (denoted as \u2206S) from the system's total energy change. Scientists call this total energy change in the systementhalpy\nand we denote it as \u2206H. The formula for calculating \u2206G is as follows, where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in\nKelvin (degrees Celsius + 273):\nWe express a chemical reaction's standard free energy change as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product (either in\nkilojoules or kilocalories, kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions. We\ngenerally calculate standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions at pH 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees Celsius, and\n100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively. Note that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions,\nand so standard calculated \u2206G values for biological reactions will be different inside the cell.\nEndergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions\nIf energy releases during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number. In\nother words, reactions that release energy have a \u2206G < 0. A negative \u2206G also means that the reaction's products have less free\nenergy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. Scientists call reactions that have a\nnegative \u2206G and consequently release free energyexergonic reactions. Think:exergonic means energy isexiting the system. We\nalso refer to these reactions as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without adding energy into the system.\nUnderstanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists, because\nthese reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. We must draw an important distinction between the term\nspontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a\nspontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. Rusting iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that\noccurs slowly, little by little, over time.\nIf a chemical reaction requires an energy input rather than releasing energy, then the \u2206G for that reaction will be a positive\nvalue. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, we can think of the reactions' products as\nenergy-storing molecules. We call these chemical reactionsendergonic reactions, and they are non-spontaneous. An\nendergonic reaction will not take place on its own without adding free energy.\nLet\u2019s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. Remember that building complex\nmolecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. Therefore, the chemical reactions\ninvolved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. Alternatively the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler\nmolecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the rust example above, the sugar breakdown involves\nspontaneous reactions, but these reactions do not occur instantaneously.Figure 6.8shows some other examples of endergonic\nand exergonic reactions. Later sections will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous\nreactions happen more efficiently.\n\n--- Page 182 ---\n162",

We\ngenerally calculate standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions at pH 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees Celsius, and\n100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively. Note that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions,\nand so standard calculated \u2206G values for biological reactions will be different inside the cell.\nEndergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions\nIf energy releases during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number. In\nother words, reactions that release energy have a \u2206G < 0. A negative \u2206G also means that the reaction's products have less free\nenergy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. Scientists call reactions that have a\nnegative \u2206G and consequently release free energyexergonic reactions. Think:exergonic means energy isexiting the system. We\nalso refer to these reactions as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without adding energy into the system.\nUnderstanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists, because\nthese reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. We must draw an important distinction between the term\nspontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a\nspontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. Rusting iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that\noccurs slowly, little by little, over time.\nIf a chemical reaction requires an energy input rather than releasing energy, then the \u2206G for that reaction will be a positive\nvalue. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, we can think of the reactions' products as\nenergy-storing molecules. We call these chemical reactionsendergonic reactions, and they are non-spontaneous. An\nendergonic reaction will not take place on its own without adding free energy.\nLet\u2019s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. Remember that building complex\nmolecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. Therefore, the chemical reactions\ninvolved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. Alternatively the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler\nmolecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the rust example above, the sugar breakdown involves\nspontaneous reactions, but these reactions do not occur instantaneously.Figure 6.8shows some other examples of endergonic\nand exergonic reactions. Later sections will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous\nreactions happen more efficiently.\n\n--- Page 182 ---\n162"

Exergonic reactions release energy. Endergonic\nreactions require energy to proceed.\nActivation Energy\nThere is another important concept that we must consider regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic\nreactions require a small amount of energy input before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. These reactions\nhave a net release of energy, but still require some initial energy. Scientists call this small amount of energy input necessary for\nall chemical reactions to occur theactivation energy(or free energy of activation) abbreviated as E (Figure 6.10).\nA\nWhy would an energy-releasing, negative \u2206G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the steps that\ntake place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds break and new ones form. For\nexample, when a glucose molecule breaks down, bonds between the molecule's carbon atoms break. Since these are energy-\nstoring bonds, they release energy when broken. However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule\nmust be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. This contorted state is the\ntransition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason, reactant molecules do not last long in their transition\nstate, but very quickly proceed to the chemical reaction's next steps. Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a\ngiven reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a\nlower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state\nof the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, E is always positive.\nA\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch an animation of the move from free energy to transition state atthis(http://openstax.org/l/energy_reaction)site.\nFrom where does the activation energy that chemical reactants require come? The activation energy's required source to push\nreactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings.Heat energy(the total bond energy of reactants or products in\na chemical reaction) speeds up the molecule's motion, increasing the frequency and force with which they collide. It also moves\natoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state. For this reason, heating a system will\ncause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently. Increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect.\nOnce reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition state, the reaction will\nproceed.\nThe activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed. The higher the activation energy, the\nslower the chemical reaction. The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. This reaction occurs slowly over\ntime because of its high E .

The matter and its environment\nrelevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside that system is the\nsurroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water.\nEnergy transfers within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An\nopen system is one in which energy can transfer between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because\nit can lose heat into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.\nBiological organisms are open systems. Energy exchanges between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-\nstoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to\nthe laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this total amount of energy\nis constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe.\nEnergy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may transfer from place to place or\ntransform into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place\naround us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from\nnatural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of\nconverting sunlight energy into the chemical energy stored within organic molecules (Figure 6.2).Figure 6.11examples of energy\ntransformations.\nThe challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform\ninto usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well.

In every energy transfer, some\namount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, scientists define\nheat energyas energy that transfers from one system to another that is not doing work.

This is good for warm-blooded creatures like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature.

The more energy that a system loses to\nits surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder\nwithin a system asentropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 6.12). To better understand entropy, think\nof a student\u2019s bedroom. If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy. It would exist in a very\ndisordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the system, in the form of the student doing work and putting\neverything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order. This state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a\ncar or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state. Left alone, a house's or car's\nentropy gradually increases through rust and degradation. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy\nas well. For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases, and as molecules at a high\nconcentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nTransfer of Energy and the Resulting Entropy\nSet up a simple experiment to understand how energy transfers and how a change in entropy results.\n1.

These high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and\nthird (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups. These bonds are \u201chigh-\nenergy\u201d because the products of such bond breaking\u2014adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group\n(P)\u2014have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP and a water molecule. Because this reaction takes place using a\ni\nwater molecule, it is a hydrolysis reaction. In other words, ATP hydrolyzes into ADP in the following reaction:\nLike most chemical reactions, ATP to ADP hydrolysis is reversible. The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP + P. Cells rely\ni\non ATP regeneration just as people rely on regenerating spent money through some sort of income. Since ATP hydrolysis\nreleases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy. This equation expresses ATP formation:\nTwo prominent questions remain with regard to using ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy releases with ATP\nhydrolysis, and how does that free energy do cellular work? The calculated \u2206G for the hydrolysis of one ATP mole into ADP and P\ni\nis \u22127.3 kcal/mole (\u221230.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under standard conditions, one would expect a different value\nexists under cellular conditions. In fact, the \u2206G for one ATP mole's hydrolysis in a living cell is almost double the value at\nstandard conditions: \u201314 kcal/mol (\u221257 kJ/mol).\nATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + P, and the\ni\nfree energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question we posed above discusses how ATP hydrolysis\nenergy release performs work inside the cell. This depends on a strategy scientists call energy coupling. Cells couple the ATP\nhydrolysis' exergonic reaction allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane\nion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+pump) drives sodium out of\nthe cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 6.14). A large percentage of a cell\u2019s ATP powers this pump, because cellular processes\nbring considerable sodium into the cell and potassium out of it. The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations\nof sodium and potassium. In order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K+ions), one\nATP molecule must hydrolyze. When ATP hydrolyzes, its gamma phosphate does not simply float away, but it actually transfers\nonto the pump protein. Scientists call this process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule phosphorylation. As with most\nATP hydrolysis cases, a phosphate from ATP transfers onto another molecule. In a phosphorylated state, the Na+/K+pump has\nmore free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows it to release Na+to the cell's outside.\nIt then binds extracellular K+, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump.\nThis phosphate release triggers the K+to release to the cell's inside. Essentially, the energy released from the ATP hydrolysis\ncouples with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na+and K+ions. ATP performs cellular work using this basic\nform of energy coupling through phosphorylation.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure6.14The sodium-potassium pump is an example of energy coupling.

Almost all enzymes are proteins, comprised of amino acid chains, and they perform the critical task of lowering\nthe activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell. Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules, and holding\nthem in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily. It is important\nto remember that enzymes do not change the reaction's \u2206G. In other words, they do not change whether a reaction is exergonic\n(spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the reactants' or products' free energy. They only reduce the\nactivation energy required to reach the transition state (Figure 6.15).\nFigure6.15Enzymes lower the reaction's activation energy but do not change the reaction's free energy.\nEnzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity\nThe chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme\u2019ssubstrates.

In\nothers, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction, both become\nmodified, and leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is the enzyme\u2019s\nactive site. This is where the \u201caction\u201d happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues\n(also side chains, or R groups) within the active site. Different properties characterize each residue. These can be large or small,\nweakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of\namino acid residues, their positions, sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within\nthe active site. This specific environment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates). Due to\nthis jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition\nstate and the active site), enzymes are known for their specificity. The \u201cbest fit\u201d results from the shape and the amino acid\nfunctional group\u2019s attraction to the substrate. There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each\nchemical reaction; however, there is flexibility as well.\nThe fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject to\nlocal enviromental influences. It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates,\nenzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect\nchemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures will\neventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, todenature, a process that changes the substance's natural\nproperties. Likewise, the local environment's pH can also affect enzyme function. Active site amino acid residues have their own\nacidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis. These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that can impair the way\nsubstrate molecules bind. Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with temperature, extreme\nenvironmental pH values (acidic or basic) can cause enzymes to denature.\nInduced Fit and Enzyme Function\nFor many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple \u201clock-and-key\u201d fashion. This model\nasserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports a\nmore refined view scientists callinduced fit(Figure 6.16). This model expands upon the lock-and-key model by describing a\nmore dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes\na mild shift in the enzyme\u2019s structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and the substrate's\ntransition state. This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme\u2019s ability to catalyze its reaction.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an induced fit animation atthis website(http://openstax.org/l/hexokinase).\nWhen an enzyme binds its substrate, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex lowers the reaction's activation\nenergy and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that\ninvolve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. The appropriate region (atoms\nand bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the other molecule's appropriate region with which it must react. Another way in\nwhich enzymes promote substrate reaction is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur.\nCertain chemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar environment. The chemical properties that\nemerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an\nenzyme\u2019s specific substrates to react.\nYou have learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or slightly\ncontorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform. Enzymatic action can aid this process. The\nenzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bond-\nbreaking, helping to reach the transition state. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical\nreaction itself. The amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with\nsubstrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. In these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will\nalways return to its original state at the reaction's completion. One of enzymes' hallmark properties is that they remain\nultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, it releases its product(s).\n\n--- Page 190 ---\n170",

Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from\nthe active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme\u2019s active site(s) for its substrate(s).\nFigure6.18Allosteric inhibitors modify the enzyme's active site so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented.

Most of these pathways are\ncombinations of oxidation and reduction reactions, which occur at the same time. An oxidation reaction\nstrips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a\nreduction reaction. Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are\ncalled oxidation reduction reactions, orredox reactions.\nElectrons and Energy\nThe removal of an electron from a molecule (oxidizing it), results in a decrease in potential energy in the\noxidized compound. The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom) does not remain unbonded,\nhowever, in the cytoplasm of a cell. Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the\nsecond compound.The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy\nfrom the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second\ncompound (the reduced compound).The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most\nof the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The\ntransfer of energy in the form of high-energy electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an\nincremental fashion\u2014in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on\nthe extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking\nthe path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.\nElectron Carriers\nIn living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: they bind and carry high-energy\nelectrons between compounds in biochemical pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are\nderived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced\n(that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)\n(Figure 7.2) is derived from vitamin B, niacin. NAD+is the oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the\n3\nreduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton (which together are the\nequivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron). Note that if a compound has an \u201cH\u201d on it, it is\ngenerally reduced (e.g., NADH is the reduced form of NAD).\nNAD+can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation:\nWhen electrons are added to a compound,it is reduced. A compound that reduces another is called a\nreducing agent. In the above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD+is reduced to NADH. When\nelectrons are removed from a compound,it is oxidized. A compound that oxidizes another is called an\noxidizing agent. In the above equation, NAD+is an oxidizing agent, and RH is oxidized to R.\nSimilarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is derived from vitamin B , also called riboflavin. Its reduced\n2\nform is FADH . A second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group. Both NAD+and FAD+\n2\nare extensively used in energy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic\nreactions and photosynthesis in plants.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 201 ---",

Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell,\nwhich would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to\nhandle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells\naccomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the \u201cenergy currency\u201d of the cell, and,\nlike currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a\nrechargeable battery.\nWhen ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The energy is used to do\nwork by the cell, usually when the released phosphate binds to another molecule, thereby activating it. For example, in the\nmechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the active\ntransport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that\nfunctions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions\nagainst their electrochemical gradients.\nATP Structure and Function\nAt the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a\nribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (Figure 7.3). Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA, and AMP is one of the\nnucleotides in RNA.

(Credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nCAREER CONNECTION\nMitochondrial Disease Physician\nWhat happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? This may happen in mitochondrial\ndiseases, which are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or\nmitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. In type 2 diabetes, for\ninstance, the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of\nrespiration. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and\nloss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases.\nIdentifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession\nrequires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be\nboard certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations\ndevoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited\nMetabolic Disorders.\n\n--- Page 204 ---\n184",

                "text": "Glycolysis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022 Describe the overall result in terms of molecules produced during the chemical breakdown of glucose by\nglycolysis\n\u2022 Compare the output of glycolysis in terms of ATP molecules and NADH molecules produced\nAs you have read, nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar glucose.Glycolysisis the\nfirst step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. In fact, nearly all living organisms carry out\nglycolysis as part of their metabolism. The process does not use oxygen directly and therefore is termedanaerobic. Glycolysis\ntakes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways. One\nmethod is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. The\nother mechanism uses a group of integral proteins calledGLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. These\ntransporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.\nGlycolysis begins with the six-carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-\ncarbon sugar calledpyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. The first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose\nmolecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-\ncarbon molecules. The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and\nNADH\u2014remember: this is the reduced form of NAD.\nFirst Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Requiring Steps)\nStep 1. The first step in glycolysis (Figure 7.6) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the\nphosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate, producing\nglucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from\ncontinuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will\nnot allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.\nStep 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers,\nfructose-6-phosphate (this isomer has a phosphate attached at the location of the sixth carbon of the ring). Anisomeraseis an\nenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (This change from phosphoglucose to\nphosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.)\nStep 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A second\nATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In this pathway,\nphosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less active when ADP\nlevels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is \u201csufficient\u201d ATP in the system, the pathway slows down. This\nis a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.\nStep 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis\nemploys an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone phosphate\nand glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\nStep 5. In the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\nThus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. At this point in the pathway, there is a net\ninvestment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 205 ---",

Both of these\nmolecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP\nmolecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even higher-\nenergy NADH molecules.\nStep 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 7.7) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy\nelectrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD+, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition\nof a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Note that the second phosphate group does not require\nanother ATP molecule.\nFigure7.7The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two NADH and four ATP\nmolecules per glucose.\nHere again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the\noxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD+. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD+in order to keep this\nstep going. If NAD+is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in the system, the\nNADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will\nbe used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of\nNADH to NAD+.\nStep 7. In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction),\n1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP.

In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of\nglycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, which are the sites of cellular respiration. There, pyruvate is transformed into\nan acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting compound is\ncalledacetyl CoA. CoA is derived from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid. Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but\nits major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.\nBreakdown of Pyruvate\nIn order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. The conversion is a\nthree-step process (Figure 7.8).\nStep 1.A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium.

Almost all of the\nenzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is\nembedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: the last part of\nthe pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step.

In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is used in\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine triphosphate\n(GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in\nwhich they are found. One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal muscle. This form\nproduces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver.\nThis form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more restricted. In particular, protein\nsynthesis primarily uses GTP.\nStep 6. Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to FAD,\nreducing it to FADH . (Note: the energy contained in the electrons of these hydrogens is insufficient to reduce NAD+but\n2\nadequate to reduce FAD.) Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron\ntransport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner\nmembrane of the mitochondrion.\nStep 7. Water is added by hydrolysis to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle\nregenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is then produced in the process.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an animation of the citric acid cyclehere(http://openstax.org/l/krebs_cycle).\nProducts of the Citric Acid Cycle\nTwo carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose\nmolecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the\nmost recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all\nsix carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each turn of the cycle\nforms three NADH molecules and one FADH molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration,\n2\nthe electron transport chain, to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate\ncompounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing nonessential amino acids; therefore, the cycle isamphibolic(both\ncatabolic and anabolic).",

The removal of the\n2\nhydrogen ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient that forms the foundation for the process of chemiosmosis.\nChemiosmosis\nIn chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons)\nacross the mitochondrial membrane. The uneven distribution of H+ions across the membrane establishes both concentration\nand electrical gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions\u2019 positive charge and their aggregation\non one side of the membrane.\nIf the membrane were continuously open to simple diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across\ninto the matrix, driven by the concentrations producing their electrochemical gradient.

Similarly, hydrogen ions in the\nmatrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane by an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase\n(Figure 7.11). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down\ntheir electrochemical gradient.

It is generally thought that\nthe first cells arose in an aqueous environment\u2014a \u201csoup\u201d of nutrients\u2014possibly on the surface of some porous clays, perhaps in\nwarm marine environments. If these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily, it follows that the cells\nwould begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived as they shifted the nutrients into the components of\ntheir own bodies. This hypothetical situation would have resulted in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist\nby using the nutrients that remained in their environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials upon which they\ncould survive. Selection would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the nutrients to which they had\naccess.\nAn early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun\u2019s energy using water as a source of hydrogen atoms, but this\npathway did not produce free oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis). (Another type of anoxygenic photosynthesis did not produce\nfree oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen ions; instead, it used materials such as hydrogen sulfide and\nconsequently produced sulfur). It is thought that glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars\nbeing produced but that these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. The development of\nglycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials\nspontaneously accumulating in the \u201cprimeval soup.\u201d A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of electrons and\nhydrogen and generated free oxygen. Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated, but not before the oxygen released\noxidized metals in the ocean and created a \u201crust\u201d layer in the sediment, permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic\nphotosynthesizers. Living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to\nevolve. When the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally\nable to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric\nacid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.",

High levels of ATP or citrate or a lower, more acidic pH\ndecreases the enzyme\u2019s activity. An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle.\nFermentation, with its production of organic acids such as lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell;\nhowever, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells.\nThe last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or converted into\nthe amino acid alanine. If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme is inhibited. The enzyme\u2019s\nactivity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase. (Recall that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in\nthe first half of glycolysis.) The regulation of pyruvate kinase involves phosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase), resulting in\na less-active enzyme. Dephosphorylation by a phosphatase reactivates it. Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP (a negative\nallosteric effect).\nIf more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. If\neither acetyl groups or NADH accumulates, there is less need for the reaction, and the rate decreases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is\nalso regulated by phosphorylation: a kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates it. The\nkinase and the phosphatase are also regulated.\nCitric Acid Cycle\nThe citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of NADH\n(Figure 7.9). These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. When adequate ATP and NADH\nlevels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease.

It is the only biological\nprocess that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and converts it into chemical compounds\n(carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. It is also a source of oxygen necessary for\nmany living organisms. In brief, the energy of sunlight is \u201ccaptured\u201d to energize electrons, whose energy is\nthen stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds?\nThe energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy\ncaptured and stored by photosynthesis 350 to 200 million years ago during the Carboniferous Period.\nPlants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing\nphotosynthesis (Figure 8.2). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called\nphotoautotrophs(literally, \u201cself-feeders using light\u201d). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most\nother bacteria, are termedheterotrophs(\u201cother feeders\u201d), because they must rely on the sugars produced by\nphotosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize\nsugars, not by using sunlight\u2019s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds. For\nthis reason, they are referred to aschemoautotrophs.\nFigure8.2Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds\nvia photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous\nareas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e)\nthermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem\nsurrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopuses that derive\nenergy from the bacteria.

Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99\npercent of Earth\u2019s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 8.3), the wolf is at the end of an\nenergy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer,\nand finally to the wolf.\nFigure8.3The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. The predator that eats these\ndeer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed.

After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), as well as simple carbohydrate molecules (high in energy) that can then be converted into\nglucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon\nthat all living things need to survive.\nFigure8.4Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates. Oxygen is generated as a\nwaste product of photosynthesis.\n\n--- Page 228 ---\n208",

In the\nlight-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical\nenergy. In thelight-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the\nassembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a\nreactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, however, several enzymes of the\nlight-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store\nthe energy: These are referred to asenergy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to\nlight-independent reactions can be thought of as \u201cfull\u201d because they are rich in energy.

Humans can see only a tiny fraction of this energy, which we refer to as \u201cvisible light.\u201d The manner in\nwhich solar energy travels is described as waves.

Scientists\ndifferentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum.

(credit: modification of work by NASA)\nUnderstanding Pigments\nDifferent kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only specific wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or\ntransmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear a mixture of the reflected or transmitted light colors.\nChlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has\nmultiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls:a,b,canddand a related molecule found in prokaryotes\ncalledbacteriochlorophyll.Chlorophyllaandchlorophyllbare found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the\nfollowing discussion.\nWith dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit\u2014such as the\nred of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (\u03b2-carotene)\u2014are used as\nadvertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis,carotenoidsfunction as photosynthetic pigments that are very\nefficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are\nrequired to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage.\nTherefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat.\nEach type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light: This is termed the\nabsorption spectrum. The graph inFigure 8.13shows the absorption spectra for chlorophylla, chlorophyllb, and a type of\ncarotenoid pigment called \u03b2-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks\nand troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyllaabsorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible\nspectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. Carotenoids\nabsorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.\n\n--- Page 234 ---\n214",

The light-dependent\nreactions are depicted inFigure 8.15. Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce NADPH and ATP. The\nnumbering of the photosystems is derived from the order in which they were discovered, not in the order of the transfer of\nelectrons.\nFigure8.15A photosystem consists of 1) a light-harvesting complex and 2) a reaction center. Pigments in the light-harvesting complex\npass light energy to two special chlorophyllamolecules in the reaction center. The light excites an electron from the chlorophyllapair,\nwhich passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must then be replaced. In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from\nthe splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste product. In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron\ntransport chain discussed below.\nThe actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called aphotosystem, two\ntypes of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane:photosystem II(PSII) andphotosystem I(PSI) (Figure 8.16).\nThe two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron supply) and what they\nreduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons).\nBoth photosystems have the same basic structure; a number ofantenna proteinsto which the chlorophyll molecules are bound\nsurround thereaction centerwhere the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by thelight-harvesting\ncomplex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a\nmixture of 300 to 400 chlorophyllaandbmolecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids.

The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by\naerobic organisms to support respiration.\nAs electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. This energy is used to move hydrogen\natoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by\nsplitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP in a later step. Because the electrons have\nlost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna.\nThat energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (calledP700). P700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to NADP+to\nform NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce\nNADP+into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly\nequal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine-tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast\u2019s constantly\nchanging energy needs.\nGenerating an Energy Carrier: ATP\nAs in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the\nthylakoid lumen creates aconcentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the\nthylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of\ncellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling\neach other.\nTo release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the\nthylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by the\nhydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (Figure\n8.16). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an\narea of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure of the thylakoid.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit thissite(http://openstax.org/l/light_reactions)and click through the animation to view the process of photosynthesis\nwithin a leaf.",

Only one carbon dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle must be completed\nthree times to produce a single three-carbon G3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na. In photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. G3P and water are products.\nb. In photosynthesis, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide are reactants. G3P and oxygen are products.\nc. In photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. RuBP and oxygen are products.\nd. In photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. G3P and oxygen are products.\nRuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO and RuBP. For each CO molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules of\n2 2\nanother compound 3-phospho glyceric acid (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle\ninvolves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the\nsame, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 C atoms from 3CO + 15 C atoms from 3RuBP = 18 C atoms\n2\nin 6 molecules of 3-PGA). This process is calledcarbonfixation, because CO is \u201cfixed\u201d from an inorganic form into organic\n2\nmolecules.\nStage 2: Reduction\nATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. (Recall that areductionis the\ngain of an electron by an atom or molecule.) Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is released with\nthe loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost,\nconverting it into NADP+. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and re-\nenergized.\nStage 3: Regeneration\nInterestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the\nformation of other compounds needed by the plant. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it\ntakes three \u201cturns\u201d of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three\nturns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate\nRuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these\n2\nregeneration reactions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThislink(http://openstax.org/l/calvin_cycle)leads to an animation of photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPhotosynthesis\nDuring the evolution of photosynthesis, a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis that involves only one\nphotosystem and is typically anoxygenic (does not generate oxygen) into modern oxygenic (does generate oxygen)\nphotosynthesis, employing two photosystems. This modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organisms\u2014from giant\ntropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cells\u2014and the process and components of this photosynthesis remain\nlargely the same. Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of ATP\nand NADH. The subsequent light-independent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy.\nIn the harsh dry heat of the desert, plants must conserve every drop of water must be used to survive. Because stomata must\nopen to allow for the uptake of CO , water escapes from the leaf during active photosynthesis. Desert plants have evolved\n2\nprocesses to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. Mechanisms to capture and store CO allows plants to adapt to\n2\nliving with less water. Some plants such as cacti (Figure 8.19) can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a\ntemporary carbon fixation/storage process, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler\ntemperatures. During the day cacti use the captured CO for photosynthesis, and keep their stomata closed.\n2\n\n--- Page 240 ---\n220",

Paracrine signals move by diffusion\nthrough the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short period of time. In\norder to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by\nneighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly\ndiffuse through the intracellular space if released again.\nOne example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell\nbody, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which\ntransmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called\na synapse. Asynaptic signalis a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by\nfast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the\nnext cell by the release of chemical ligands calledneurotransmittersfrom the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The\nneurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances (20\u201340 nanometers) between nerve cells, which are called\nchemical synapses(Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an\nimmediate response, such as, \"Take your hand off the stove!\"\nWhen the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target\ncell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are\ndegraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to\nrespond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.\nFigure9.3The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell\u2014called the synaptic gap\u2014is very small and allows for rapid\ndiffusion of the neurotransmitter. Enzymes in the synapatic gap degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.\nEndocrine Signaling\nSignals from distant cells are calledendocrine signals, and they originate fromendocrine cells. (In the body, many endocrine\ncells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.) These types of\nsignals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect.

Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.\nCell-Surface Receptors\nCell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that\nbind to external ligand molecules. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, through\nwhich an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not\nhave to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are\nspecific to individual cell types.\nBecause cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a\nmalfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor\nmolecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.\nEach cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain called theextracellular domain, a\nhydrophobic membrane-spanning region called a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The size\nand extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nHow Viruses Recognize a Host\nUnlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to sustain metabolic life.\nSome viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell enclosing DNA or RNA. To reproduce, viruses must invade a living\ncell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular apparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?\nViruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human influenza (flu) binds\nspecifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical differences in the cell-surface receptors\namong hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for example, humans) often cannot infect another species (for\nexample, chickens).\nHowever, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral reproduction can occur\nrapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in newly produced viruses; these changes mean\nthat the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new\nhost. Such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus\nwith new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings\nwhere animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.1Once a virus jumps the former \"species barrier\"\nto a new host, it can spread quickly. Scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging viruses) closely in the hope that\n1A. B. Sigalov, The School of Nature. IV. Learning from Viruses, Self/Nonself 1, no. 4 (2010): 282-298. Y.

Such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus\nwith new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings\nwhere animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.1Once a virus jumps the former \"species barrier\"\nto a new host, it can spread quickly.

These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain\ncellular proteins.\nCalcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because\nion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously remove it by using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP).

The response to the\nincrease in Ca2+varies and depends on the cell type involved.

ERK phosphorylates MNK1, which in turn\nphosphorylates eIF-4E, an elongation initiation factor that, with other initiation factors, is associated with mRNA. When eIF-4E becomes\nphosphorylated, the mRNA unfolds, allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin. (SeeFigure 9.10for the phosphorylation pathway\nthat activates ERK.)\nAnother mechanism of gene regulation involves PKC, which can interact with is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. Aninhibitor\nis a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the inhibitor is a\nprotein called I\u03ba-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-\u03baB. (The symbol \u03ba represents the Greek letter kappa.) When I\u03ba-B\nis bound to NF-\u03baB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when I\u03ba-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer\nbind NF-\u03baB, and NF-\u03baB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In this case, the effect of\nphosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.\nIncrease in Cellular Metabolism\nThe result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by\nadrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone\n(produced by the adrenal gland located on top of the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP\nactivates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation of\nglycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP)\nthat catabolizes glycogen into its constituent glucose monomers. (Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for\nshort-term storage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme,\nglycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready pool of\nglucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen, thus\npreventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in\nresponse to a sudden surge of adrenaline\u2014the \u201cfight or flight\u201d reflex.\nCell Growth\nCell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals\nfrom other cells. The ligands that promote cell growth are calledgrowth factors. Most growth factors bind to cell-surface\nreceptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activation\nof RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP kinase pathway described\n\n--- Page 262 ---\n242",

Cells on\nthe path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication,\nand nuclear and cytoplasmic division that ultimately produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases:\ninterphase and the mitotic phase (Figure 10.5). Duringinterphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During themitotic\nphase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell cytoplasm is typically partitioned by a third\nprocess of the cell cycle calledcytokinesis. We should note, however, that interphase and mitosis (karyokinesis) may take place\nwithout cytokinesis, in which case cells with multiple nuclei (multinucleate cells) are produced.\nFigure10.5The cell cycle in multicellular organisms consists of interphase and the mitotic phase. During interphase, the cell grows and the\nnuclear DNA is duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are\nsegregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Following mitosis, the cytoplasm is usually divided as well by cytokinesis, resulting in two\ngenetically identical daughter cells.\nInterphase\nDuring interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move\nfrom interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are\ncalledG, S, and G.\n1 2\nG Phase (First Gap)\n1\nThe first stage of interphase is called theG phase(first gap) because, from a microscopic point of view, little change is visible.\n1\nHowever, during the G stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of\n1\nchromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of\nreplicating each chromosome in the nucleus.\nS Phase (Synthesis of DNA)\nThroughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In theS phase, DNA replication\ncan proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules\u2014sister chromatids\u2014that\nare firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is also duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes of\nhomologous chromosomes will give rise to themitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes\nduring mitosis. For example, roughly at the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes are associated with a pair of rod-like\nobjects, thecentrioles, which are positioned at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. We should note,\n\n--- Page 278 ---\n258",

The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure.\nThis fissure is called thecleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is\ncleaved in two (Figure 10.8).\nIn plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates\nenzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell.\nDuring telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form aphragmoplast(a vesicular structure) at the\nmetaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called acell plate. As\nmore vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose\nthat has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma\nmembrane on either side of the new cell wall (Figure 10.8).\nFigure10.8During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate. The ring contracts, forming a cleavage\nfurrow, which divides the cell in two. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former metaphase plate, forming a phragmoplast. A cell\nplate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows from the center toward the cell walls, and the membranes of the\nvesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides the cell in two.\nG Phase\n0\nNot all cells adhere to the classic cell-cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory\nphases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase, and cytokinesis. Cells inG phaseare not actively preparing to\n0\ndivide. The cell is in aquiescent(inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G temporarily due to\n0\nenvironmental conditions such as availability of nutrients, or stimulation by growth factors. The cell will remain in this phase\nuntil conditions improve or until an external signal triggers the onset of G. Other cells that never or rarely divide, such as\n1\nmature cardiac muscle and nerve cells, remain in G permanently.\n0\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nDetermine the Time Spent in Cell-Cycle Stages\nProblem: How long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage of mitosis?\nBackground: A prepared microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections will show cells arrested in various stages of the\ncell cycle.

The G checkpoint, also called the\n1 1\nrestriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division process. External influences, such\nas growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves and cell size,\n1\nthere is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed\n1\nto progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance\ninto G and await further signals when conditions improve.\n0\nThe G Checkpoint\n2\nThe G checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. As at the G checkpoint, cell size and\n2 1\nprotein reserves are assessed. However, the most important role of the G checkpoint is to ensure that all of the chromosomes\n2\nhave been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA,\nthe cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.\nThe M Checkpoint\nThe M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle\ncheckpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. Because\nthe separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores\nof each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch what occurs at the G, G , and M checkpoints by visiting thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/cell_checkpnts)to see an\n1 2\nanimation of the cell cycle.\nRegulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle\nIn addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle.\nThese regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative\nregulation). Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other regulatory\nproteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one\nmechanism controls the same event. However, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and\npossibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.\nPositive Regulation of the Cell Cycle\nTwo groups of proteins, calledcyclinsandcyclin-dependent kinases(Cdks), are termed positive regulators. They are responsible\nfor the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell\ncycle in a predictable pattern (Figure 10.11). Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and\ninternal signals. After the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are\ndegraded by cytoplasmic enzymes, as shown inFigure 10.11below.\n\n--- Page 286 ---\n266",

To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind to a cyclin protein and then be\nphosphorylated by another kinase.\nBecause the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are largely based on thetiming of the cell cycleand not on specific events,\nregulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes. Without a specific\nconcentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.\nAlthough the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several\nother mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. These mechanisms\nessentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that prevent the full\nactivation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell-\ncycle event. The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor\nmonitors is completed.\n\n--- Page 288 ---\n268",

                "text": "Cancer and the Cell Cycle\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022 Describe how cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell growth\n\u2022 Understand how proto-oncogenes are normal cell genes that, when mutated, become oncogenes\n\u2022 Describe how tumor suppressors function\n\u2022 Explain how mutant tumor suppressors cause cancer\nCancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the redundancy\nand overlapping levels of cell-cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell-cycle checkpoint\nsurveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell-cycle controls are fully\nfunctional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA\nnucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start\nwhen a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction.\nThe change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to\ncyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow\nsubsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the\ndaughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage.\nEventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled\ngrowth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (\u201c-oma\u201d) can result.\nProto-oncogenes\nThe genes that code for the positive cell-cycle regulators are calledproto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that,\nwhen mutated in certain ways, becomeoncogenes\u2014genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen\nto the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a\nless functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing\nthe cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce,\nthe mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that\nincreases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered\nwith cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter\ncells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the\norganism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells may\naccumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.\nThe Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell-cycle\nregulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell-cycle checkpoints. An\noncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell-cycle progression.\nTumor Suppressor Genes\nLike proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell-cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous.\nTumor suppressor genesare segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that, when\nactivated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-understood tumor\nsuppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell-cycle progression until certain events are completed.\nA cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem. Tumor\nsuppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash!\nMutated p53 genes have been identified in more than 50 percent of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in\nlight of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors present\n1\nin the genomic DNA (Figure 10.14). Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to\nsignal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected. At this point, a functional p53\nwill deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged version of p53 found in cancer\ncells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.\n\n--- Page 290 ---\n270",

                "text": "The Process of Meiosis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022 Describe the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis, and the differences between the first\nand second meiotic divisions\n\u2022 Describe the cellular events that take place during meiosis\n\u2022 Explain the differences between meiosis and mitosis\n\u2022 Explain the mechanisms within the meiotic process that produce genetic variation among\nthe haploid gametes\nSexual reproduction requires the union of two specialized cells, calledgametes, each of which contains one\nset of chromosomes. When gametes unite, they form azygote, or fertilized egg that contains two sets of\nchromosomes. (Note: Cells that contain one set of chromosomes are calledhaploid; cells containing two sets\nof chromosomes are calleddiploid.) If the reproductive cycle is to continue for any sexually reproducing\nspecies, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets to produce haploid\ngametes; otherwise, the number of chromosome sets will double with every future round of fertilization.\nTherefore, sexual reproduction requires a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets by\nhalf.\nMost animals and plants and many unicellular organisms are diploid and therefore have two sets of\nchromosomes. In eachsomatic cellof the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes\nor reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, calledhomologous\nchromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical\nlocations along their lengths. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from\neach parent.\nMeiosisis thenuclear divisionthat forms haploid cells from diploid cells, and it employs many of the same\ncellular mechanisms as mitosis. However, as you have learned,mitosisproduces daughter cells whose nuclei\nare genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei\nare at the same \u201cploidy level\u201d\u2014diploid in the case of most multicellular most animals. Plants use mitosis to\ngrow as sporophytes, and to grow and produce eggs and sperm as gametophytes; so they use mitosis for\nboth haploid and diploid cells (as well as for all other ploidies). In meiosis, the starting nucleus is always\ndiploid and the daughter nuclei that result are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number,\nmeiosis consists of one round of chromosome replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division.\nBecause the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the\nsame stage names are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and\nthe stages are designated with a \u201cI\u201d or a \u201cII.\u201d Thus,meiosis Iis the first round of meiotic division and\nconsists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Likewise,Meiosis II(during which the second round of\nmeiotic division takes place) includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.\nMeiosis I\nMeiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of G, S, and G phases, which are nearly identical to the\n1 2\nphases preceding mitosis. The G phase (the \u201cfirst gap phase\u201d) is focused on cell growth. During the S\n1\nphase\u2014the second phase of interphase\u2014the cell copies orreplicatesthe DNA of the chromosomes. Finally,\nin the G phase (the \u201csecond gap phase\u201d) the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.\n2\nDuring DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical\ncopies\u2014sister chromatidsthat are held together at the centromere bycohesinproteins, which hold the\nchromatids together until anaphase II.\nProphase I\nEarly in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly with a microscope, the homologous\nchromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins\nto break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair closer together. Recall\nthat in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. Thesynaptonemal complex, a lattice of\nproteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads outward\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 301 ---",

In\nsynapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The\nsynaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between homologous nonsister chromatids\u2014a\nprocess calledcrossing over. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange aschiasmata(singular = chiasma) (Figure\n11.2).\nIn humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not completely homologous (that is, most of their genes differ), there\nis a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal\ncomplex develops only between the regions of homology.\nFigure11.2Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are bound tightly together\nand in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin proteins at the centromere.\nLocated at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies calledrecombination nodules. These\nassemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process ofcrossover\u2014or genetic\nrecombination\u2014between the nonsister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule, the double-stranded DNA of each\nchromatid is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the nonsister chromatids. As prophase I\nprogresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the synaptonemal\ncomplex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The\nchiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome.\nThere must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but\nthere may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between\nhomologous pairs is removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3). These\npairs are calledtetradsbecause the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.\nThe crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between\nhomologous nonsister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a\npaternal chromosome. When a recombinant sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one\nparent and some DNA from the other parent. The recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes\nthat did not exist before the crossover. Crossover events can occur almost anywhere along the length of the synapsed\nchromosomes. Different cells undergoing meiosis will therefore produce different recombinant chromatids, with varying\ncombinations of maternal and parental genes. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect,\nexchanging segments of DNA to produce genetically recombined chromosomes.\n\n--- Page 302 ---\n282",

Why are meiosis and\nsexual reproductive strategies so common? These are important (and as yet unanswered) questions in biology, even though they\nhave been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the 20th century. There are several possible explanations,\none of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and\nreproduction of the population. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an\notherwise similar asexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. Mutations\nthat take place during the formation of germ cell lines are also the ultimate source of variation in sexually reproducing\norganisms. However, in contrast to mutation during asexual reproduction, the mutations during sexual reproduction can be\ncontinually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are\nmixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Red Queen Hypothesis\nGenetic variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary, even under seemingly stable\nenvironmental conditions? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.3The concept was named\nin reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's book,Through the Looking-Glass.\nAll speciescoevolve(evolve together) with other organisms. For example, predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve\nwith their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species a reproductive edge over close competitors,\npredators, parasites, or even prey. However, survival of any given genotype or phenotype in a population is dependent on the\nreproductive fitness of other genotypes or phenotypes within a given species. The only method that will allow a coevolving\nspecies to maintain its own share of the resources is to alsocontinually improve itsfitness(the capacity of the members to\nproduce more reproductively viable offspring relative to others within a species). As one species gains an advantage, this\nincreases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species\nprogresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a\nmechanism to improve rapidly. Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen\u2019s catchphrase was, \u201cIt takes all the\nrunning you can do to stay in the same place.\u201d This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species.\nLife Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms\nFertilization and meiosis alternate in sexuallife cycles.

Fertilization, the joining of two haploid\ngametes, restores the diploid condition. Some organisms have a multicellular diploid stage that is most obvious and only\nproduce haploid reproductive cells. Animals, including humans, have this type of life cycle. Other organisms, such as fungi, have\na multicellular haploid stage that is most obvious. Plants and some algae have alternation of generations, in which they have\nmulticellular diploid and haploid life stages that are apparent to different degrees depending on the group.\nNearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are\nthe gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, calledgerm cells, are produced within the\ngonads (such as the testes and ovaries). Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the germ cell line and meiosis to produce\nhaploid gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again.

Mutations\nthat take place during the formation of germ cell lines are also the ultimate source of variation in sexually reproducing\norganisms. However, in contrast to mutation during asexual reproduction, the mutations during sexual reproduction can be\ncontinually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are\nmixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Red Queen Hypothesis\nGenetic variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary, even under seemingly stable\nenvironmental conditions? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.3The concept was named\nin reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's book,Through the Looking-Glass.\nAll speciescoevolve(evolve together) with other organisms. For example, predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve\nwith their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species a reproductive edge over close competitors,\npredators, parasites, or even prey. However, survival of any given genotype or phenotype in a population is dependent on the\nreproductive fitness of other genotypes or phenotypes within a given species. The only method that will allow a coevolving\nspecies to maintain its own share of the resources is to alsocontinually improve itsfitness(the capacity of the members to\nproduce more reproductively viable offspring relative to others within a species). As one species gains an advantage, this\nincreases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species\nprogresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a\nmechanism to improve rapidly. Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen\u2019s catchphrase was, \u201cIt takes all the\nrunning you can do to stay in the same place.\u201d This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species.\nLife Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms\nFertilization and meiosis alternate in sexuallife cycles. What happens between these two events depends on the organism\u2019s\n\u201creproductive strategy.\u201d The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid\ngametes, restores the diploid condition. Some organisms have a multicellular diploid stage that is most obvious and only\nproduce haploid reproductive cells. Animals, including humans, have this type of life cycle. Other organisms, such as fungi, have\na multicellular haploid stage that is most obvious. Plants and some algae have alternation of generations, in which they have\nmulticellular diploid and haploid life stages that are apparent to different degrees depending on the group.\nNearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are\nthe gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, calledgerm cells, are produced within the\ngonads (such as the testes and ovaries). Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the germ cell line and meiosis to produce\nhaploid gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life\nstage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (Figure\n11.8).\n3Leigh Van Valen, \u201cA New Evolutionary Law,\u201dEvolutionary Theory1 (1973): 1\u201330\n\n--- Page 310 ---\n290"

The haploid multicellular plants are calledgametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells. Meiosis is\nnot directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes is already\nhaploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise\nto a diploid multicellular plant called asporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce\nhaploid spores. The spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes (Figure 11.10).\n\n--- Page 312 ---\n292",

In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in\nhoneybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primarymodel system(a system with\nconvenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems). In\n1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural\nHistory Society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted from parents to offspring independently of\nother traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he published his work,Experiments in Plant\nHybridization,1in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Br\u00fcnn.\nMendel\u2019s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which believed, incorrectly, that the\nprocess of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical\nappearance in offspring. Theblending theory of inheritanceasserted that the original parental traits were\nlost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case. This hypothetical\nprocess appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation.Continuous variation\nresults from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to\nbe a \u201cblend\u201d of their parents\u2019 traits.\nInstead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes\n(specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to asdiscontinuous variation. Mendel\u2019s choice of\nthese kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor\n1Johann Gregor Mendel,Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Br\u00fcnn, Bd.

In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the\nmonastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific\ncontributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by\nscientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.\nMendel\u2019s Model System\nMendel\u2019s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea,Pisum sativum, to study inheritance. This species naturally self-\nfertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after\npollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or \u201ctrue-breeding,\u201d pea plants. These are plants\nthat always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the\nappearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to\nmaturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large\nquantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about\nsimply by chance.\nMendelian Crosses\nMendel performedhybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea,\nwhich is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one\nvariety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the male gametes (sperm) to\nthe stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below. To\nprevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel painstakingly removed\nall of the anthers from the plant\u2019s flowers before they had a chance to mature.\nPlants used in first-generation crosses were calledP , or parental generation one (Figure 12.3). After each cross, Mendel\n0\ncollected the seeds belonging to the P plants and grew them the following season. These offspring were called theF, or the first\n0 1\nfilial (filial= offspring, daughter or son) generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F generation of plants, he\n1\nallowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F plants to produce theF , or second\n1 2\nfilial, generation. Mendel\u2019s experiments extended beyond the F generation to the F and F generations, and so on, but it was\n2 3 4\nthe ratio of characteristics in the P \u2212F\u2212F generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel\u2019s\n0 1 2\npostulates.\n\n--- Page 320 ---\n300",

After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross,Mendel found that 100 percent of the Fhybrid\n1\ngeneration had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time (the blending theory) would have predicted the hybrid flowers\nto be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental\ntraits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel\u2019s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F\n1\ngeneration had completely disappeared.\nImportantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F plants to self-fertilize and found that, of\n1\nF -generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white\n2\nflower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white\nflowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait.\nThis is called areciprocal cross\u2014a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the\nrespective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics Mendel examined, the F and F\n1 2\ngenerations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F\n1\ngeneration only to reappear in the F generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 (Table 12.1).\n2\nThe Results of Mendel\u2019s Garden Pea Hybridizations\nCharacteristic Contrasting P Traits F Offspring Traits F Offspring Traits F Trait Ratios\n0 1 2 2\n705 violet\nFlower color Violet vs. white 100 percent violet 3.15:1\n224 white\n651 axial\nFlower position Axial vs. terminal 100 percent axial 3.14:1\n207 terminal\n787 tall\nPlant height Tall vs. dwarf 100 percent tall 2.84:1\n277 dwarf\n5,474 round\nSeed texture Round vs. wrinkled 100 percent round 2.96:1\n1,850 wrinkled\n6,022 yellow\nSeed color Yellow vs. green 100 percent yellow 3.01:1\n2,001 green\n882 inflated\nPea pod texture Inflated vs. constricted 100 percent inflated 2.95:1\n299 constricted\n428 green\nPea pod color Green vs. yellow 100 percent green 2.82:1\n152 yellow\nTable12.1\nUpon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into\nexpressed and latent traits.

Diploid organisms produce haploid gametes, which contain one\ncopy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote.\nFor cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not\nencode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on\nhomologous chromosomes are calledalleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is\ncommon to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.\nPhenotypes and Genotypes\nTwo alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable\ntraits expressed by an organism are referred to as itsphenotype. An organism\u2019s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both\nphysically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called itsgenotype. Mendel\u2019s hybridization experiments demonstrate the\ndifference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had\ngreen pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically\n1\nidentical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods\nwas not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F offspring. Therefore, the F plants must have been genotypically\n2 1\ndifferent from the parent with yellow pods.\nThe P plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that\n1\narehomozygousat a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes. Mendel\u2019s\nparental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P plants with\n1\ncontrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring wereheterozygousfor the contrasting trait, meaning that their\ngenotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.\nDominant and Recessive Alleles\nOur discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F heterozygous offspring were identical to\n1\none of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles\nwas dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was\nreferred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous\nchromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous\norganisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). The recessive allele will only be\nobserved in homozygous recessive individuals (Table 12.4).\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 325 ---",

You do a test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled peas\n(genotyperr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas. You end up with three plants, all which have round peas.\nFrom this data, can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous? If the round pea parent\nplant is heterozygous, what is the probability that a random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be round?\nMany human diseases are genetically inherited. A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive\ngenetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on to\nhis or her offspring. Of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. Instead, geneticists usepedigree\nanalysisto study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases (Figure 12.6).\n\n--- Page 328 ---\n308",

Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple\nalleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed.

However, in some parts of the world,\nthe parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by\ngeographic region.\nFigure12.10The (a)Anopheles gambiae, or African malaria mosquito, acts as a vector in the transmission to humans of the malaria-\ncausing parasite (b)Plasmodium falciparum, here visualized using false-color transmission electron microscopy. (credit a: James D.\nGathany; credit b: Ute Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America,P. falciparumhas developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine,\nmefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.P. falciparum, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to\nhumans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of thedhpsgene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are\nassociated with each of these alleles. Being haploid,P. falciparumneeds only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.\nIn Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of thedhpsgene are localized to different geographic regions. This is a\ncommon evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other\nP. falciparumisolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where\nthis drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers\nwithin an infection cycle,P. falciparumevolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of\ncommonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug\ncombinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.2\nX-Linked Traits\nIn humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes. The\nsex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns\namong non-sex chromosomes, orautosomes. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a\nhomologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains\na small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and\ncontains many fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome, but not on the Y chromosome, it is\nsaid to beX-linked.\nEye color inDrosophilawas one of the first X-linked traits to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X\nchromosome in 1910. Like humans,Drosophilamales have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX. In flies, the wild-type\neye color is red (XW) and it is dominant to white eye color (Xw) (Figure 12.11). Because of the location of the eye-color gene,\nreciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said to behemizygous, because they have only one allele\nfor any X-linked characteristic. Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males.\nDrosophilamales lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be XWY or XwY. In contrast,\nfemales have two allele copies of this gene and can be XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.\n2Sumiti Vinayak, et al., \u201cOrigin and Evolution of Sulfadoxine ResistantPlasmodium falciparum,\u201dPublic Library of Science Pathogens6, no. 3 (2010):\ne1000830, doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000830.\n\n--- Page 332 ---\n312",

When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked\ntrait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express the trait, as\nthey will inherit their father's Y chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color blindness,\nhemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and\nmay not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half\nof their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.\nIn some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather\nthan the male. This is the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in which they\nare hemizygous.\nHuman Sex-linked Disorders\nSex-linkage studies in Morgan\u2019s laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding X-linked recessive disorders in\nhumans, which include red-green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia. Because human males need to inherit only\none recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must inherit\nrecessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. When they inherit one recessive X-linked\nmutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected. Carrier\nfemales can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X chromosomes.\nHowever, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute\nthe recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait (Figure 12.13). Although some Y-\nlinked recessive disorders exist, typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not transmitted to\nsubsequent generations.\n\n--- Page 334 ---\n314",

What are\nthe possible genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea plants? How many squares do you need to do a\nPunnett square analysis of this cross?\nFor the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either anRallele or anrallele along with either a\nYallele or ayallele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which anrallele sorted would be equally likely\nto contain either aYallele or ayallele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when theYyRrheterozygote\nis self-crossed, as follows:YR,Yr,yR, andyr. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 \u00d7 4 Punnett square (Figure\n12.16) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3\nround/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 12.16). These are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we\nperformed the crosses with a large enough sample size.\nBecause of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios,\ncharacteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and considering only\nseed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F generation offspring would be round, and\n2\none quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the F offspring\n2\nwould be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can\napply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F offspring is expected to be (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16, and the\n2\nproportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16. These proportions are identical to those obtained\nusing a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of\nthese genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) \u00d7 (1/\n4) = 3/16.\nThe law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR) parents\nwould yield the same F and F offspring as in theYYRRxyyrrcross.\n1 2\nThe physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line up\nin random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the\ngenes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.\n\n--- Page 338 ---\n318",

The recessivecallele does not produce pigment, and a mouse with the homozygous recessivecc\ngenotype is albino regardless of the allele present at theAlocus. Thus, theCgene is epistatic to theAgene.\nEpistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is expressed\nin this way. Homozygous recessive expression of theWgene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or heterozygous\nexpression of theYgene (YYorYy) generates yellow fruit, and thewwyygenotype produces green fruit. However, if a dominant\ncopy of theWgene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless\nof theYalleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy\u00d7WwYy) would produce offspring with a phenotypic\nratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.\nFinally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same\nphenotype. In the shepherd\u2019s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by two genes in\na dominant epistatic relationship.

With improved microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell\nbiologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell\ndivision and meiosis. With each mitotic division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous\n(no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and\nmigrated to separate cellular poles.\nChromosomal Theory of Inheritance\nThe speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to\nexamine Mendel\u2019s publications and reevaluate his model in terms of chromosome behavior during mitosis\nand meiosis. In 1902, Theodor Boveri observed that proper sea urchin embryonic development does not\noccur unless chromosomes are present. That same year, Walter Sutton observed chromosome separation\ninto daughter cells during meiosis (Figure 13.2). Together, these observations led to theChromosomal\nTheory of Inheritance, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian\ninheritance.\nFigure13.2(a) Walter Sutton and (b) Theodor Boveri developed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which states\nthat chromosomes carry the unit of heredity (genes).\nThe Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel\u2019s laws, which the following\nobservations supported:\n\u2022 During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of\nother chromosome pairs.\n\u2022 Chromosome sorting from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random.\n\u2022 Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half their chromosomal complement.\n\u2022 Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the\nsame number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.\n\u2022 The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same\nchromosome number as their parents.\nDespite compelling correlations between chromosome behavior during meiosis and Mendel\u2019s abstract laws,\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 351 ---",

                "text": "\u2022 Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage 331\nscientists proposed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance long before there was any direct evidence that chromosomes\ncarried traits. Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes. It\nwas only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster, that Thomas Hunt Morgan\nprovided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.\nGenetic Linkage and Distances\nMendel\u2019s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other. Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence between\na segregating trait and the X chromosome, suggesting that random chromosome segregation was the physical basis of Mendel\u2019s\nmodel. This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel\u2019s predicted outcomes. That each chromosome can carry many\nlinked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have chromosomes. However, researchers in\nMorgan\u2019s laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited together. During\nmeiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.\nHomologous Recombination\nIn 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata\u2014the point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange\nsegments\u2014prior to the first meiosis division. He suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically exchange\nsegments. As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct points. Janssen\nsuggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments exchanged. We now know that the pairing\nand interaction between homologous chromosomes, or synapsis, does more than simply organize the homologs for migration\nto separate daughter cells. When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in\nhomologous recombination, or more simply, \u201ccrossing over.\u201d\nTo better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous\nindividual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such asAB) and two recessive\npaternal alleles for those same genes (such asab). If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes\nthat are eitherABorabwith a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produceAB,Ab,aB, andabgametes with\nequal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment. Because they correspond to new allele\ncombinations, the genotypes Ab and aB arenonparental typesthat result from homologous recombination during meiosis.\nParental typesare progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. Morgan and his colleagues, however,\nfound that when they test crossed such heterozygous individuals to a homozygous recessive parent (AaBb\u00d7aabb), both parental\nand nonparental cases occurred. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were eitherAaBboraabb, but 50 offspring\nwould also result that were eitherAabboraaBb. These results suggested that linkage occurred most often, but a significant\nminority of offspring were the products of recombination.\n\n--- Page 352 ---\n332",

(d) The actual\nrecombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent. A crossover\nfrequency between 0 percent and 50 percent indicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover sometimes occurs.\nIn a test cross for two characteristics such as the one here, can the recombinant offspring's predicted frequency be 60 percent?\nWhy or why not?\nGenetic Maps\nJanssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that scientists did not widely\nbelieve. Scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how chromosomes could break and\nrejoin. Yet, the data were clear that linkage did not always occur. Ultimately, it took a young undergraduate student and an \u201call-\nnighter\u201d to mathematically elucidate the linkage and recombination problem.\nIn 1913, Alfred Sturtevant, a student in Morgan\u2019s laboratory, gathered results from researchers in the laboratory, and took them\nhome one night to mull them over. By the next morning, he had created the first \u201cchromosome map,\u201d a linear representation of\ngene order and relative distance on a chromosome (Figure 13.4).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure13.4This genetic map ordersDrosophilagenes on the basis of recombination frequency.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na. Recombination of the body color and red/cinnabar eye alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of the alleles\nfor wing length and aristae length.\nb. Recombination of the body color and aristae length alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of red/brown eye\nalleles and the aristae length alleles.\nc. Recombination of the gray/black body color and long/short aristae alleles will not occur.\nd. Recombination of the red/brown eye and long/short aristae alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of the\nalleles for wing length and body color.\nAsFigure 13.4shows, by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, we can infer the relative gene order on\nchromosome 2. The values represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which correspond to recombination frequencies (in\npercent). Therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5 \u2212 48.5 = 17 cM apart, indicating that the maternal and\npaternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average.\nTo construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. He also\nassumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood\nanywhere along the chromosome's length. Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles that were far\napart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which\nrecombination could occur. Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited\n\n--- Page 354 ---\n334",

To obtain a view of an individual\u2019s karyotype, cytologists\nphotograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, orkaryogram. Another name is an\nideogram (Figure 13.5).\nFigure13.5This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have the same centromere\npositions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of the XX pair. (credit: Andreas Blozer et al)\nIn a given species, we can identify chromosomes by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. In a human\nkaryotype,autosomesor \u201cbody chromosomes\u201d (all of the non\u2013sex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order\nof size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes. However,\nchromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. Researchers discovered this after naming Down syndrome as trisomy\n21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total). Not wanting to change the name\nof this important disease, scientists retained the numbering of chromosome 21 despite describing it having the shortest set of\nchromosomes. We may designate the chromosome \u201carms\u201d projecting from either end of the centromere as short or long,\ndepending on their relative lengths. We abbreviate the short armp(for \u201cpetite\u201d); whereas, we abbreviate the long armq(because\nit follows \u201cp\u201d alphabetically). Numbers further subdivide and denote each arm. Using this naming system, we can describe\nchromosome locations consistently in the scientific literature.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nGeneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations\nAlthough we refer to Mendel as the \u201cfather of modern genetics,\u201d he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the\ngeneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which geneticists\ncan identify traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities from a single cell. To observe an individual\u2019s karyotype, a\ngeneticist first collects a person\u2019s cells (like white blood cells) from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, he or she\nstimulates the isolated cells to begin actively dividing. The geneticist then applies the chemical colchicine to cells to arrest\ncondensed chromosomes in metaphase. The geneticist then induces swelling in the cells using a hypotonic solution so the\nchromosomes spread apart. Finally, the geneticist preserves the sample in a fixative and applies it to a slide.\nThe geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize each chromosome pair's distinct and\nreproducible banding patterns. Following staining, the geneticist views the chromosomes using bright-field microscopy. A\ncommon stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giemsa staining results in approximately 400\u2013800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and\ncondensed proteins) arranged along all 23 chromosome pairs. An experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to\nthe banding patterns, geneticists further identify chromosomes on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the\nclassic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous chromosome pairs align in numerical order from longest to shortest,\nthe geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern\n(Figure 13.5).\nAt its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes\nper cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which one identifies by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome,\nwhich has the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two characterizes. Geneticists can also\nidentify large DNA deletions or insertions. For instance, geneticists can identify Jacobsen Syndrome\u2014which involves distinctive\nfacial features as well as heart and bleeding defects\u2014by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint\ntranslocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another\n\n--- Page 356 ---\n336",

Nondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes.\nAneuploidy\nScientists call an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their specieseuploid. In humans, euploidy\ncorresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome number is\ndescribed asaneuploid, a term that includesmonosomy(losing one chromosome) ortrisomy(gaining an extraneous\nchromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they\nlack essential genes. This underscores the importance of \u201cgene dosage\u201d in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop\nto birth; however, duplications of some smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several\nweeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Individuals\nwith an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products, which that chromosome encodes. This extra\ndose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. The most\ncommon trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Short stature and\nstunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays characterize\nindividuals with this inherited disorder. We can correlate the incidence of Down syndrome with maternal age. Older women are\nmore likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype (Figure 13.7).\nFigure13.7The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically with maternal age.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisualize adding a chromosome that leads to Down syndrome in thisvideo simulation(http://openstax.org/l/down_syndrome).\nPolyploidy\nWe call an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species)polyploid. For instance,\nfertilizing an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely\nrare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Polyploid animals are sterile\nbecause meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable\nzygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to\nproduce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and\nmore robust than euploids of their species (Figure 13.8).\n\n--- Page 358 ---\n338",

Individuals with three X chromosomes,\ntriplo-X, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY genotype, corresponding to\none type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and\nreduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X\nchromosomes. In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic\ndosage. We see this as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a\nsingle sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region,\nhearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.\nDuplications and Deletions\nIn addition to losing or gaining an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may duplicate or lose itself. Duplications and\ndeletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal\nsegments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French for \u201ccry of the cat\u201d) is a\nsyndrome that occurs with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most\n5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) (Figure 13.10).

We can identify both during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes\nwith their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment.

In rare instances, such a\nchange can result in new species evolving. In fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to\nhuman evolution. This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees\ndiffer cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in\nchimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans.\nScientists believe the pericentric chromosome 18 inversion occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common\nancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that\napproximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on\nchromosome 18 of an ancestral human.\nA comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes\u2014ROCK1and\nUSP14\u2014that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly\npositioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes.\nInterestingly, humans and chimpanzees expressUSP14at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and\nfibroblasts. Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression\nlevels in a useful way. Because bothROCK1andUSP14encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular\nfunction. We do not know how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the\ndivergence of humans from other primates.1\nTranslocations\nAtranslocationoccurs when a chromosome segment dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome.\nTranslocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to\nregulatory sequences. Notably, specific translocations have occurred with several cancers and with schizophrenia. Reciprocal\ntranslocations result from exchanging chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no\ngenetic information gain or loss (Figure 13.13).\nFigure13.13A reciprocal translocation occurs when a DNA segment transfers from one chromosome to another, nonhomologous\nchromosome.

In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure 14.2), a physician by profession, isolated\nphosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells (leukocytes). He named these chemicals (which would\neventually be known as DNA)nucleinbecause they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\nFigure14.2Friedrich Miescher (1844\u20131895) discovered nucleic acids.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo see Miescher conduct his experiment that led to his discovery of DNA and associated proteins in the\nnucleus, click throughthis review(http://openstax.org/l/miescher_levene).\nA half century later, in 1928, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith reported the first demonstration of\nbacterialtransformation\u2014a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing its\nmorphology and physiology. Griffith conducted his experiments withStreptococcus pneumoniae,a\nbacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains of this bacterium called rough (R) and\nsmooth (S). (The two cell types were called \u201crough\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d after the appearance of their colonies grown\non a nutrient agar plate.)\nThe R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease). The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing), and\nhas a capsule outside its cell wall. The capsule allows the cell to escape the immune responses of the host\nmouse.\nWhen Griffith injected the living S strain into mice, they died from pneumonia. In contrast, when Griffith\ninjected the live R strain into mice, they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the\nheat-killed S strain, they also survived. This experiment showed that the capsule alone was not the cause of\ndeath. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into\nmice, and\u2014to his surprise\u2014the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S\nstrain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died.\nGriffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and\ntransformed it into the pathogenic S strain. He called this thetransforming principle(Figure 14.3). These\nexperiments are now known as Griffith's transformation experiments.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 367 ---",

The R strain is non-pathogenic, whereas the\nS strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The\nS strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain,\ntransforming the R strain into the S strain in the process. (credit \"living mouse\": modification of work by NIH; credit \"dead mouse\":\nmodification of work by Sarah Marriage)\nScientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle\nfurther. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) as these were\npossible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used\neach mixture separately to transform the R strain. They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no\nlonger able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. This led them to\nconclude that DNA was the transforming principle.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nForensic Scientist\nForensic Scientists used DNA analysis evidence for the first time to solve an immigration case. The story started with a teenage\nboy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him,\nthinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the\nimmigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the\nauthorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester\nUniversity in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known asDNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities\napproached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, as well as an unrelated\nmother, and compared the samples with the boy\u2019s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three\nchildren was compared with the boy\u2019s DNA. He found a match in the boy\u2019s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings. He\nconcluded that the boy was indeed the mother\u2019s son.\nForensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the\nDNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis\nincludes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to\npresent their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists\nexperimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college\nand university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in\nchemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.\nAlthough the experiments of Avery, McCarty and McLeod had demonstrated that DNA was the informational component\ntransferred during transformation, DNA was still considered to be too simple a molecule to carry biological information.\nProteins, with their 20 different amino acids, were regarded as more likely candidates. The decisive experiment, conducted by\nMartha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952, provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was indeed the genetic material and not\nproteins. Chase and Hershey were studying abacteriophage\u2014a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple\n\n--- Page 368 ---\n348",

The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous (nitrogen-bearing)\nbase, a 5-carbon sugar (pentose), and a phosphate group (Figure 14.5). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous\nbase. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and\nthymine (T).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure14.5The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in\nsize; they have a single six-membered ring structure.\nThe images above illustrate the five bases of DNA and RNA. Examine the images and explain why these are called \u201cnitrogenous\nbases.\u201d How are the purines different from the pyrimidines? How is one purine or pyrimidine different from another, e.g.,\nadenine from guanine? How is a nucleoside different from a nucleotide?\nThe purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in\nsize; they have a single six-membered ring structure.\nThe sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5'\n(1' is read as \u201cone prime\u201d). The phosphate, which makes DNA and RNA acidic, is connected to the 5' carbon of the sugar by the\nformation of an ester linkage between phosphoric acid and the 5'-OH group (an ester is an acid + an alcohol). In DNA\nnucleotides, the 3' carbon of the sugar deoxyribose is attached to a hydroxyl (OH) group. In RNA nucleotides, the 2' carbon of the\nsugar ribose also contains a hydroxyl group. The base is attached to the 1'carbon of the sugar.\nThe nucleotides combine with each other to produce phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate residue attached to the 5' carbon of\nthe sugar of one nucleotide forms a second ester linkage with the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next\nnucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond. In a polynucleotide, one end of the chain has a free 5' phosphate, and\nthe other end has a free 3'-OH. These are called the 5' and 3' ends of the chain.\nIn the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of\nCambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field. Pauling\n\n--- Page 370 ---\n350",

The method is based on the use of chain\nterminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPSs differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' OH group\non the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing DNA strand, the chain cannot be extended any further because the\nfree 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of deoxynucleotides to\ndideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.\nFigure14.8In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to generate DNA fragments\nthat terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis (not defined) on the basis of size, and from the order of\nfragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram (not defined) that is\ngenerated by a laser scanner.\nThe DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured (separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures). The DNA is\ndivided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleoside triphosphates (A, T, G, and C) are added. In\naddition, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddCTP, ddATP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) are added to\neach tube respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the\nfour dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide\nis incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a\ndifference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner that detects the fluorescent\nmarker of each fragment. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSanger\u2019s genome sequencing has led to a race to sequence human genomes at rapid speed and low cost. Learn more by viewing\nthe animationhere(https://openstax.org/l/DNA_and_genomes).\nGel electrophoresisis a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical\ncalledagarose(a polysaccharide polymer extracted from seaweed that is high in galactose residues). Agarose powder is added to\na buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on\nthe gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the\npositive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest\nfragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest\nto the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it (Figure 14.9).\n\n--- Page 372 ---\n352",

In prokaryotic cells, both\nprocesses occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages might there be to\nhaving them occur together?\nThe size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes,E.coli,is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut\nand stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling.\nSupercoiling suggests that DNA is either \u201cunder-wound\u201d (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or \u201cover-wound\u201d\n(more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling;\nother proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their\nDNA inside the nucleus (Figure 14.11). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known ashistonesto form\nstructures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an\noctamer composed of two molecules of each of four different histones. The DNA (remember, it is negatively charged because of\nthe phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a\nlinker DNA. This is also known as the \u201cbeads on a string\u201d structure. With the help of a fifth histone, a string of nucleosomes is\nfurther compacted into a 30-nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. Metaphase chromosomes are even further\ncondensed by association with scaffolding proteins. At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact,\napproximately 700 nm in width.\nIn interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged\nregion is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains\ngenes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains\ngenes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.\n\n--- Page 374 ---\n354",

This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. Thus, the process is quite rapid and\noccurs without many mistakes.\nDNA replication employs a large number of structural proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the\nprocess. One of the key players is the enzymeDNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one-by-one to\nthe growing DNA chain that is complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy\nis obtained from the nucleoside triphosphates ATP, GTP, TTP and CTP. Like ATP, the otherNTPs(nucleoside triphosphates) are\nhigh-energy molecules that can serve both as the source of DNA nucleotides and the source of energy to drive the\npolymerization. When the bond between the phosphates is \u201cbroken,\u201d the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester\nbond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known:\nDNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I is\nan important accessory enzyme in DNA replication, and along with DNA pol II, is primarily required for repair.\nHow does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called\norigins of replicationwhere replication begins. InE. coli,which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome (as do\nmost prokaryotes), this origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of\nreplication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme calledhelicaseunwinds the DNA by breaking the\nhydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped\nstructures calledreplication forksare formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get\nextended bi-directionally as replication proceeds.Single-strand binding proteinscoat the single strands of DNA near the\nreplication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix.\nDNA polymerase has two important restrictions: it is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can\nbe only extended in this direction). It also requires a free 3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a\nphosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide. This essentially means that it cannot\nadd nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available. Then how does it add the first nucleotide?

Another enzyme, RNAprimase, synthesizes an RNA segment that is about\nfive to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the template DNA. Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is\nappropriately called theprimer. DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one-by-one that are\ncomplementary to the template strand (Figure 14.14).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure14.14A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication. The DNA tends to become\nmore highly coiled ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase breaks and reforms DNA\u2019s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication\nfork, thereby relieving the pressure that results from this \u201csupercoiling.\u201d Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to\nprevent the helix from re-forming. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter\nDNA strand. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches\ncalled Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments,\njoining the fragments into a single DNA molecule. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nQuestion: You isolate a cell strain in which the joining of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has\noccurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?\nThe replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA\ndouble helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and\nthen resealing it. Because DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, and because the DNA double helix is\nantiparallel, there is a slight problem at the replication fork.The two template DNA strands have opposing orientations:one\nstrand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. Only one new DNA strand, the one that is\ncomplementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, can be synthesized continuously towards the replication fork. This\ncontinuously synthesized strand is known as theleading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA,\nis extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known asOkazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start\nthe synthesis. New primer segments are laid down in the direction of the replication fork, but each pointing away from it.\n(Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is\nknown as thelagging strand.)\nThe leading strand can be extended from a single primer, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short\nOkazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein\ncalled thesliding clampholds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-\nshaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by\nDNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, which uses DNA behind the RNA as its own primer and\nfills in the gaps left by removal of the RNA nucleotides by the addition of DNA nucleotides. The nicks that remain between the\nnewly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA\nligase, which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkages between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate\nend of the other fragment.\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division.\n\n--- Page 378 ---\n358",

Because DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, and because the DNA double helix is\nantiparallel, there is a slight problem at the replication fork.The two template DNA strands have opposing orientations:one\nstrand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. Only one new DNA strand, the one that is\ncomplementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, can be synthesized continuously towards the replication fork. This\ncontinuously synthesized strand is known as theleading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA,\nis extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known asOkazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start\nthe synthesis. New primer segments are laid down in the direction of the replication fork, but each pointing away from it.\n(Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is\nknown as thelagging strand.)\nThe leading strand can be extended from a single primer, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short\nOkazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein\ncalled thesliding clampholds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-\nshaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by\nDNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, which uses DNA behind the RNA as its own primer and\nfills in the gaps left by removal of the RNA nucleotides by the addition of DNA nucleotides. The nicks that remain between the\nnewly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA\nligase, which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkages between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate\nend of the other fragment.\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division.\n\n--- Page 378 ---\n358"

In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known\nas autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in\nE. coli.\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than in prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have\nmajor roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol\u03b1, pol\u03b2, pol\u03b3, pol\u03b4, and pol\u03b5.\nThe essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available\nas a template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. Histones\nmust be removed and then replaced during the replication process, which helps to account for the lower replication rate in\neukaryotes. The chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the\nDNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of\nreplication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Helicase and other proteins are then recruited to\nstart the replication process (Table 14.2).\nDifference between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Replication\nProperty Prokaryotes Eukaryotes\nOrigin of replication Single Multiple\nRate of replication 1000 nucleotides/s 50 to 100 nucleotides/s\nDNA polymerase types 5 14\nTelomerase Not present Present\nRNA primer removal DNA pol I RNase H\nStrand elongation DNA pol III Pol \u03b1, pol \u03b4, pol \u03b5\nSliding clamp Sliding clamp PCNA\nTable14.2\nA helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication origin\nas the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication\nfork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer,\nDNA pol can start synthesis. Three major DNA polymerases are then involved: \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03b5. DNA pol \u03b1 adds a short (20 to 30\nnucleotides) DNA fragment to the RNA primer on both strands, and then hands off to a second polymerase. While the leading\nstrand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol\u03b5, the lagging strand is synthesized by pol\u03b4. A sliding clamp protein\nknown as PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA. As pol \u03b4 runs\ninto the primer RNA on the lagging strand, it displaces it from the DNA template. The displaced primer RNA is then removed by\nRNase H (AKA flap endonuclease) and replaced with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined\nafter the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the\nphosphodiester bond.\nTelomere replication\nUnlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you\u2019ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add\nnucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached.\nOn the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the\nreplication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no way to replace the primer on the 5\u2019 end of the lagging\nstrand. The DNA at the ends of the chromosome thus remains unpaired, and over time these ends, calledtelomeres,may get\nprogressively shorter as cells continue to divide.\n\n--- Page 380 ---\n360",

With the advent of modern medicine, preventative\nhealth care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look\nyounger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.\nIn 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in\nregenerative medicine.2Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell\ndepletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension\nof telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and\nintestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate\nuncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that\ncancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the\ntelomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be\ninhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.",

Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the\nmistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves\nmutated or defective.\nMost of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase itself.\n(Figure 14.17). Inproofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be\nmade. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the\nright base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester\nbond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the 3' exonuclease action of DNA pol. Once the incorrect\nnucleotide has been removed, it can be replaced by the correct one.\nFigure14.17Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.\nSome errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is\nknown asmismatch repair(Figure 14.18). Specific repair enzymes recognize the mispaired nucleotide and excise part of the\nstrand that contains it; the excised region is then resynthesized. If the mismatch remains uncorrected, it may lead to more\npermanent damage when the mismatched DNA is replicated. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two\nbases is the incorrect one?

A bacterial chromosome is a closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not\norganized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid region.\nIn addition, prokaryotes often have abundantplasmids, which are shorter, circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or\na few genes.

The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost\nidentical to the other DNA strand, called thenontemplate strand, or the coding strand.

RNA is synthesized in its\n5'-3' direction, using the enzyme RNA polymerase. As the template is read, the DNA unwinds ahead of the polymerase and then rewinds\nbehind it.\nThe nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed\nis called the +1 site, or theinitiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are denoted with a \u201c-\u201d and are designated\nupstream nucleotides. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with \u201c+\u201d numbering and are called\ndownstream nucleotides.\nInitiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes\nProkaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA\ndegradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple\ntranscription and translation events that occur concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic genomes are very compact,\nand prokaryotic transcripts often cover more than one gene or cistron (a coding sequence for a single protein). Polycistronic\nmRNAs are then translated to produce more than one kind of protein.\nOur discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process inEscherichia coli, a well-studied eubacterial\nspecies. Although some differences exist between transcription inE. coliand transcription in archaea, an understanding ofE.\ncolitranscription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.\nProkaryotic RNA Polymerase\nProkaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. InE. coli, the polymerase is composed of five\npolypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b2, and\u03b2', comprise the polymerasecore\nenzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each\nsubunit has a unique role; the two\u03b1-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the\u03b2-subunit binds to the\nribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent mRNA molecule; and the\u03b2' subunit binds the DNA template\nstrand. The fifth subunit,\u03c3, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the\npolymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without\u03c3, the core enzyme would transcribe from\nrandom sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five\nsubunits is called theholoenzyme.\nProkaryotic Promoters\nApromoteris a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase, binds and initiates\ntranscription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very\nimportant because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently.\nAlthough promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are evolutionarily conserved in many species. At the -10\nand -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are twopromoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across\nall promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure 15.8). The -10 sequence, called the -10 region, has the consensus\nsequence TATAAT. The -35 sequence has the consensus sequence TTGACA. These consensus sequences are recognized and\nbound by\u03c3. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A\u2013T-rich -10 region facilitates\nunwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the\nproduction of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.\nFigure15.8The\u03c3subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the\ntranscription start site. The\u03c3subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.\n\n--- Page 396 ---\n376",

The most\nimportant difference between prokaryote and eukaryote transcription is due to the latter\u2019s membrane-bound nucleus and\norganelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must\nprotect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each\ntranscribe a different subset of genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are usuallymonogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.\nInitiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes\nUnlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called\ntranscription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then to help recruit the appropriate polymerase.\nThe Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\nThe features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex than those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single\npolymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. Each\neukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.\nRNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed,\nprocessed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table 15.1). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a\ncellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of\ntranslation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs from the tandemly duplicated set of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal\ngenes. (Note that the \u201cS\u201d designation applies to \u201cSvedberg\u201d units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a\nparticle sediments during centrifugation.)\nLocations, Products, and Sensitivities of the Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\nRNA Polymerase Cellular Compartment Product of Transcription \u03b1-Amanitin Sensitivity\nI Nucleolus All rRNAs except 5S rRNA Insensitive\nII Nucleus All protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs Extremely sensitive\nIII Nucleus 5S rRNA, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs Moderately sensitive\nTable15.1\nRNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs\nundergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module\u2019s discussion of transcription\nand translation in eukaryotes will use the term \u201cmRNAs\u201d to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be\ntranslated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.\nRNA polymerase IIIis also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S\npre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), andsmall nuclearpre-RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve\nas the \u201cadaptor molecules\u201d between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs have a variety\nof functions, including \u201csplicing\u201d pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.\nA scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in\nthe presence of \u03b1-amanitin, an oligopeptide toxin produced by the fly agaric toadstool mushroom and other species ofAmanita.\nInterestingly, the \u03b1-amanitin affects the three polymerases very differently (Table 15.1).

The complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the\npolymerases and promoters. An army of other transcription factors, which bind to upstream enhancers and silencers, also help\nto regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of\ntranscription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed.\nPromoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III\nThe processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of\ntranscription factors, but the general theme is the same.\nThe conserved promoter elements for genes transcribed by polymerases I and III differ from those transcribed by RNA\npolymerase II. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These\nsequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from\n-180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III\nhave upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.\nEukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the\nDNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it\nensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Evolution of Promoters\nThe evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or\nmay not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can\ntransform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as\nwell. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a\nstructural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial\nto the cell for that gene\u2019s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.\nScientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to\ninfer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far\nupstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to\nhuman core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found\nthat promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.\nIt is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other complex organisms. However,\nthe evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution\nof the genes themselves.1\nEukaryotic Elongation and Termination\nFollowing the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and\nelongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction.\nAs discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so in this section we will focus on\nhow this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.\nAlthough the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is\nconsiderably more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins\ncalled chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. TheseDNA\u2013histone\ncomplexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight\n1H Liang et al., \u201cFast evolution of core promoters in primate genomes,\u201dMolecular Biology and Evolution25 (2008): 1239\u201344.\n\n--- Page 400 ---\n380",

Eukaryotic\n(and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein-synthesis\nmachinery.\nmRNA Processing\nThe eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. Eukaryotic protein-coding\nsequences are not continuous, as they are in prokaryotes. The coding sequences (exons) are interrupted by noncoding introns,\nwhich must be removed to make a translatable mRNA. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation also create\na molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical\nE. colimRNA lasts no more than five seconds.\nPre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and\nexported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and\nsignaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of the introns (Figure 15.11).

Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called\nmitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are\nbelieved to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial\nDNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to the central dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct\ninformation to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell\nperforms an additional RNA processing step calledRNA editingto remedy this.\nFigure15.12Trypanosoma bruceiis the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by\nthe addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)\nOther genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by\ncomplementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript. However, theguide RNAhas more A\nnucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides with which to bind. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of\nguide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide\nRNAs are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs\u2014rather than proteins\u2014serve as the\ncatalysts in RNA editing.\nRNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited.\nRNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. What could be the evolutionary\nreason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient\nprokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits\nmade to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a\nholdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.\n5' Capping\nWhile the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a7-methylguanosine capis added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a\nphosphate linkage. This functional group protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors involved in protein\nsynthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.\n3' Poly-A Tail\nOnce elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-\nrich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds a string of\napproximately 200 A residues, called thepoly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and is\nalso the binding site for a protein necessary for exporting the processed mRNA to the cytoplasm.\nPre-mRNA Splicing\nEukaryotic genes are composed ofexons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are\nexpressed), andintervening sequences calledintrons(int-ron denotes theirintervening role), which may be involved in gene\nregulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing.

Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of\ntranslation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one or more of the mRNA codons for its amino acid. For instance, if the\nsequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a leucine tRNA expressing the\ncomplementary sequence, GAU. The ability of some tRNAs to match more than one codon is what gives the genetic code its\nblocky structure.\nAs the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package.\nConsider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see\nbelow); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.\nAminoacyl tRNA Synthetases\nThe process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The\ncorresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process\nof tRNA \u201ccharging,\u201d each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by one of a group of enzymes calledaminoacyl tRNA\nsynthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of\naminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond\nbetween an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The\nactivated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released. The term \"charging\" is appropriate, since the high-\nenergy bond that attaches an amino acid to its tRNA is later used to drive the formation of the peptide bond. Each tRNA is\nnamed for its amino acid.\nThe Mechanism of Protein Synthesis\nAs with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases:initiation, elongation, and termination. The\nprocess of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we\u2019ll explore how translation occurs inE. coli, a\nrepresentative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.\nInitiation of Translation\nProtein synthesis begins with the formation of aninitiation complex. InE. coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome,\nthe mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a specialinitiator tRNA, called tRNAMetf.\nInE. colimRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with\nthe rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on\nthe mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during\ntranslation\u2014both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome\u2019s translocation. Binding of the mRNA to the 30S ribosome\nalso requires IF-III.\nThe initiator tRNA then interacts with thestart codonAUG (or rarely, GUG). This tRNA carries the amino acid methionine,\nwhich is formylated after its attachment to the tRNA. The formylation creates a \"faux\" peptide bond between the formyl carboxyl\ngroup and the amino group of the methionine. Binding of the fMet-tRNAMetfis mediated by the initiation factor IF-2. The fMet\nbegins every polypeptide chain synthesized byE. coli, but it is usually removed after translation is complete. When an in-frame\nAUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet. After\nthe formation of the initiation complex, the 30S ribosomal subunit is joined by the 50S subunit to form the translation complex.\nIn eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic IFs, and\nnucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The methionine on the charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNA, is not formylated.\ni\nHowever, Met-tRNA is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\ni\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap\nat the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap.\nOnce at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many\neukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According toKozak\u2019s rules, the nucleotides\naround the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak\u2019s rules state that the following consensus sequence must\nappear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but\ncannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.\n\n--- Page 406 ---\n386",

All cells\ncontrol or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning\non a gene to produce RNA and protein is calledgene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism\nor a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to\noccur, there must be internal chemical mechanisms that control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and\nprotein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no\nlonger needed.\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of\nenergy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes\nonly when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because\nDNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would\nhave to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.\nThe control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell\nand can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.\nProkaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression\nTo understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional\nprotein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different\nmanners.\nProkaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats\nfreely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur\nalmost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the\nprimary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic\ncell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more\nprotein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression\nis mostly at the transcriptional level.\nEukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells,\nthe DNA is contained inside the cell\u2019s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized\nRNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into\nprotein. The processes of transcription and translation arephysically separatedby the nuclear membrane;\ntranscription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the\ncytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.2). Regulation\nmay occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors\n(epigeneticlevel), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptionallevel), when the RNA is processed and\nexported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptionallevel), when the RNA is translated into\nprotein (translationallevel), or after the protein has been made (post-translationallevel).\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 417 ---",

Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different\nlevels. Epigenetic changes are inheritable changes in gene expression that do not result from changes in the DNA sequence.\nEukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA. Transcriptional access to the DNA can be controlled in two\ngeneral ways: chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. Chromatin remodeling changes the way that DNA is associated\nwith chromosomal histones. DNA methylation is associated with developmental changes and gene silencing.\nEpigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the Chromosome\nThe human genome encodes over 20,000 genes, with hundreds to thousands of genes on each of the 23 human chromosomes.\nThe DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. It is also\norganized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.\nThe first level of organization, orpacking, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins. Histones package and order\nDNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions (Figure\n16.6a). Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads\non a string (Figure 16.6b).\n\n--- Page 422 ---\n402",

These signals are functional groups added to histone proteins or to DNA and determine whether a chromosomal region\nshould be open or closed (Figure 16.8depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but\nmay be added or removed as needed. Some chemical groups (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) are attached to specific amino\nacids in histone \"tails\" at the N-terminus of the protein. These groups do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how\ntightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule and unmodified histones are\npositively charged; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. By\nadding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive, and the binding of DNA to the histones is\nrelaxed. Altering the location of nucleosomes and the tightness of histone binding opens some regions of chromatin to\ntranscription and closes others.\nThe DNA molecule itself can also be modified by methylation. DNA methylation occurs within very specific regions called CpG\nislands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter\nregions of genes. The cytosine member of the CG pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). Methylated genes are usually\nsilenced, although methylation may have other regulatory effects. In some cases, genes that are silenced during the\ndevelopment of the gametes of one parent are transmitted in their silenced condition to the offspring. Such genes are said to be\nimprinted. Parental diet or other environmental conditions may also affect the methylation patterns of genes, which in turn\nmodifies gene expression. Changes in chromatin organization interact with DNA methylation. DNA methyltransferases appear\nto be attracted to chromatin regions with specific histone modifications. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions\nwith deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.\nFigure16.8Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene\nexpression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nEpigenetic changes are not permanent, although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division and may even cross\ngenerational lines. Chromatin remodeling alters the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. If a gene is to be\ntranscribed, the histone proteins and DNA in the chromosomal region encoding that gene are modified in a way that opens the\npromoter region to allow RNA polymerase and other proteins, calledtranscription factors, to bind and initiate transcription. If\na gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed\nchromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to\nthe DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.8).\n\n--- Page 424 ---\n404",

However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA\npolymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. RNA polymerase by itself\ncannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. There are two types of transcription factors that regulate eukaryotic\ntranscription:General (or basal) transcription factorsbind to the core promoter region to assist with the binding of RNA\npolymerase.Specific transcription factorsbind to various regions outside of the core promoter region and interact with the\nproteins at the core promoter to enhance or repress the activity of the polymerase.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView the process of transcription\u2014the making of RNA from a DNA template.\nClick to view content(https://www.openstax.org/l/transcript_RNA)\nThe Promoter and the Transcription Machinery\nGenes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding\nsequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the\npromoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of\nthe promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression\ncan also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of thepromoteris to bind transcription factors that control the\ninitiation of transcription.\nWithin the core promoter region, 25 to 35 bases upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. The TATA box\nhas the consensus sequence of 5\u2019-TATAAA-3\u2019. The TATA box is the binding site for a protein complex called TFIID, which contains\na TATA-binding protein. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Some\nof these transcription factors help to bind the RNA polymerase to the promoter, and others help to activate the transcription\ninitiation complex.\nIn addition to the TATA box, other binding sites are found in some promoters. Some biologists prefer to restrict the range of the\neukaryotic promoter to the core promoter, or polymerase binding site, and refer to these additional sites as promoter-proximal\nelements, because they are usually found within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Examples of\nthese elements are the CAAT box, with the consensus sequence 5\u2019-CCAAT-3\u2019 and the GC box, with the consensus sequence 5\u2019-\nGGGCGG-3\u2019. Specific transcription factors can bind to these promoter-proximal elements to regulate gene transcription. A\ngiven gene may have its own combination of these specific transcription-factor binding sites. There are hundreds of\ntranscription factors in a cell, each of which binds specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors\nbind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as acis-acting element, because it is on the same\nchromosome just next to the gene. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their\nbinding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.\nEnhancers and Transcription\nIn some eukaryotic genes, there are additional regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called\nenhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance.

The5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is\nusually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The GTP is placed \"backward\" on the 5' end of the\nmRNA, so that the 5' carbons of the GTP and the terminal nucleotide are linked through three phosphates. Thepoly-A tail, which\nis attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a long chain of adenine nucleotides. These changes protect the two ends of the\nRNA from exonuclease attack.\nOnce the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA\nmolecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If\nthe decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time available for translation of the\nmRNA to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the mRNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more\nprotein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer\nperiods of time in the cytoplasm.\nBinding of proteins to the RNA can also influence its stability. Proteins calledRNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the\nregions of the mRNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not\ntranslated into protein are called theuntranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the\nnucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the\nprotein-coding region is called the5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the3' UTR(Figure 16.12). The\nbinding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that\nbinds.\nFigure16.12RNA-binding proteins. The protein-coding region of this processed mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).\nThe presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.\nRNA Stability and microRNAs\nIn addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to\nthe RNA molecule.

These changes protect the two ends of the\nRNA from exonuclease attack.\nOnce the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA\nmolecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If\nthe decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time available for translation of the\nmRNA to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the mRNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more\nprotein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer\nperiods of time in the cytoplasm.\nBinding of proteins to the RNA can also influence its stability. Proteins calledRNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the\nregions of the mRNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not\ntranslated into protein are called theuntranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the\nnucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the\nprotein-coding region is called the5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the3' UTR(Figure 16.12). The\nbinding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that\nbinds.\nFigure16.12RNA-binding proteins. The protein-coding region of this processed mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).\nThe presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.\nRNA Stability and microRNAs\nIn addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to\nthe RNA molecule. ThesemicroRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21 to 24 nucleotides in length. The\nmiRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein\ncalledDicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however,\nmiRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called theRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RNA\ncomponent of the RISC base-pairs with complementary sequences on an mRNA and either impede translation of the message\n\n--- Page 428 ---\n408"

Control of this process is largely dependent on\nthe RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As\nthe stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\nThe Initiation Complex and Translation Rate\nLike transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. In translation, the complex that\nassembles to start the process is referred to as the translationinitiation complex. In eukaryotes, translation is initiated by\nbinding the initiating met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. This tRNA is brought to the 40S ribosome by a protein initiation factor,\neukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-2 protein binds to the high-energy moleculeguanosine triphosphate (GTP). The\ntRNA-eIF2-GTP complex then binds to the 40S ribosome. A second complex forms on the mRNA. Several different initiation\nfactors recognize the 5' cap of the mRNA and proteins bound to the poly-A tail of the same mRNA, forming the mRNA into a\nloop. The cap-binding protein eIF4F brings the mRNA complex together with the 40S ribosome complex. The ribosome then\nscans along the mRNA until it finds a start codon AUG. When the anticodon of the initiator tRNA and the start codon are\naligned, the GTP is hydrolyzed, the initiation factors are released, and the large60S ribosomal subunitbinds to form the\ntranslation complex. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a\nconformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is\nimpeded (Figure 16.13). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, the initiation complex can form normally and translation can\nproceed.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure16.13Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.\nAn increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as\nAlzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?\nChemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity\nProteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The\naddition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes\nthese modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell\u2014for example, in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, or attached\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 429 ---",

This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in\nresponse to the environment.

Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the\nprotein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to theproteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be\ndegraded (Figure 16.14). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.\nFigure16.14Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.",

Recently, several groups of researchers have\nshown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to\ndegrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could\ndramatically decrease the RNA population, leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a\nchange in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is\nquite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that alterations in\nmiRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are\nspecifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new\ndrugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.\nCancer and Translational/Post-translational Control\nThere are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications are\nfound in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative splice\nvariants of a protein. An example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically different\noutcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. The c-Flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell-death pathway, comes in two\nforms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS). Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell-death mechanisms in\nnormal cells. However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death.\nClearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer.\nNew Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies\nScientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new\nways to treat and prevent disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns\nwithin individual tumors. This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of\npersonalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to\nspecifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited\nthe overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such\nexample is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the\nEGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression\nchanges can cause cancer.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nClinical Trial Coordinator\nA clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes coordinating patient\nschedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term\nfollow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors\nto facilitate the trial and publication of the results.

The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular\ncloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is agenetically\nmodified organism(GMO). If the foreign DNA comes from a different species, the host organism istransgenic.

In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed\nfoods.\nGene Targeting\nAlthough classical methods of studying gene function began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that\nphenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: \"What does this gene or DNA\nelement do?\" This technique, reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology. This method would be\nsimilar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing's\nfunction is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that\nthe non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene\nfunction. We collectively call the methods they use to disable gene function gene targeting.Gene targetingis the use of\nrecombinant DNA vectors to alter a particular gene's expression, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating a\ncertain gene's expression by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the organism's genome.\nBiotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture\nIt is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes.

For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats,\nchickens, and mice. We call animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA transgenic animals. Several human\nproteins are expressed in transgenic sheep and goat milk, and some are expressed in chicken eggs. Scientists have used mice\nextensively for expressing and studying recombinant gene and mutation effects.\nTransgenic Plants\nManipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide\nand pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 17.10). Plants are the most important source of\nfood for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-\nday biotechnology practices were established.\nFigure17.10Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through plant\nbiotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)\nWe call plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species transgenic plants. Because they are not natural,\ngovernment agencies closely monitor transgenic plants and other GMOs to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and\ndo not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive\ntesting is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants that\nscientists genetically engineered.\nTransformation of Plants UsingAgrobacterium tumefaciens\nGene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations.

Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they stunt the\nplants and they become more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions.A. tumefaciensaffects many plants such as\nwalnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets.

The maps that genome mapping create are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. Agenetic\nmapis an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to an\ninterstate highway map) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). Agenetic markeris a gene or sequence on a\nchromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis.\nPhysical maps present the intimate details of smaller chromosome regions (similar to a detailed road map). Aphysical mapis a\nrepresentation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and\nphysical maps are required to build a genome\u2019s complete picture. Having a complete genome map of the genome makes it easier\nfor researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-\ncausing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. We can use genome mapping in a variety of other\napplications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome\nmapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.\nGenetic Maps\nThe study of genetic maps begins withlinkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes\nto determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. Scientists used the termlinkagebefore the discovery of DNA.\nEarly geneticists relied on observing phenotypic changes to understand an organism\u2019s genotype. Shortly after Gregor Mendel\n(the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what we now call genes, other researchers observed\nthat different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by their location on\nthe same chromosome. Gene mapping relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to developing the first genetic maps.\nObservations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of\ncrosses between parents with different traits. For example, in garden pea experiments, researchers discovered, that the flower\u2019s\ncolor and plant pollen\u2019s shape were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the\nsame chromosome. We call exchanging DNA between homologous chromosome pairsgenetic recombination, which occurs by\ncrossing over DNA between homologous DNA strands, such as nonsister chromatids.

Therefore, a crossover is more likely to occur between\nthem.\nThe generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains).\nScientists based early genetic maps on using known genes as markers. Scientists now use more sophisticated markers,\nincluding those based on non-coding DNA, to compare individuals\u2019 genomes in a population. Although individuals of a given\nspecies are genetically similar, they are not identical. Every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in the\ngenome between individuals in a population are useful for genetic mapping purposes. In general, a good genetic marker is a\nregion on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.\nSome genetic markers that scientists use in generating genetic maps arerestriction fragment length polymorphisms(RFLP),\nvariable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs),microsatellite polymorphisms, and thesingle nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs).\nWe can detect RFLPs (sometimes pronounced \u201crif-lips\u201d) when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease\nthat recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which we can then analyze using gel\nelectrophoresis. Every individual\u2019s DNA will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction\nendonucleases. Scientists sometimes refer to this as an individual\u2019s DNA \u201cfingerprint.\u201d Certain chromosome regions that are\nsubject to polymorphism will lead to generating the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in\nDNA\u2019s non-coding regions. Non-coding, or \u201cjunk,\u201d DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much\nof this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in regulating\ncoding genes. The number of repeats may vary in a population\u2019s individual organisms. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar\nto VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.\nBecause genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, natural increases or decreases in the\nrecombination level given genome area affects mapping. Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots; whereas,\nothers do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by\nmultiple methods.\nPhysical Maps\nA physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides.\nThere are three methods scientists use to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence\nmapping.Cytogenetic mappinguses information from microscopic analysis of stained chromosome sections (Figure 17.12).

Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem\nsolving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and\ninterpret entire genomes.\nFor example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, the\ndoctor sequences only the DNA\u2019s coding, exon-producing regions. In 2010, doctors used whole-exome sequencing to save a\nyoung boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally,\nthey performed whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell\ndeath). The doctors used a bone-marrow transplant to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the\nfirst person to receive successful treatment based on a whole-exome sequencing diagnosis. Today, human genome sequencing is\nmore readily available and results are available within two days for about $1000.\nStrategies Used in Sequencing Projects\nThe basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the\ndideoxy method), which Fred Sanger developed in the 1970s.

In exome sequencing, the\ndoctor sequences only the DNA\u2019s coding, exon-producing regions. In 2010, doctors used whole-exome sequencing to save a\nyoung boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally,\nthey performed whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell\ndeath). The doctors used a bone-marrow transplant to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the\nfirst person to receive successful treatment based on a whole-exome sequencing diagnosis. Today, human genome sequencing is\nmore readily available and results are available within two days for about $1000.\nStrategies Used in Sequencing Projects\nThe basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the\ndideoxy method), which Fred Sanger developed in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-\nstranded template by using a primer and a regulardeoxynucleotide(dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single DNA unit.

                "text": "\u2022 Whole-Genome Sequencing 433\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small\ngenomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to developing double-barrel shotgun\nsequencing, orpairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, scientists analyze each fragment\u2019s end for overlap.\nPairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence\nbecause there is more available information.\nNext-generation Sequencing\nSince 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella ofnext-generation sequencing,\nwhich is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate\nsequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These\nsequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nComparing Sequences\nA sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA. Scientists use it to identify similar regions between cell\ntypes or species, which may indicate function or structure conservation. We can use sequence alignments to construct\nphylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program calledBLAST (basic local alignment search tool)\n(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).\nUnder \u201cBasic Blast,\u201d click \u201cNucleotide Blast.\u201d Input the following sequence into the large \"query sequence\" box:\nATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the \"Species\" field and type \"human\" or \"Homo sapiens\". Then click \u201cBLAST\u201d to\ncompare the inputted sequence against the human genome\u2019s known sequences. The result is that this sequence occurs in over a\nhundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see a short\ndescription of each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on \"Graphics\". This will bring you to\na page that shows the sequence\u2019s location within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag\nback and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected sequence by\nclicking the \"ATG\" button.\nUse of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms\nBritish biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Fred Sanger used a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs), to\ncompletely sequence the first genome. Other scientists later sequenced several other organelle and viral genomes. American\nbiotechnologist, biochemist, geneticist, and businessman Craig Venter sequenced the bacteriumHaemophilus influenzaein the\n1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on sequencing the genome of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae,\nwhich began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome sequencing. By 1997, the\ngenome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacteriumEscherichia coliK12 and the yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We now know the genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouseMus musculus, the fruit fly\nDrosophila melanogaster, the nematodeCaenorhabditis. elegans, and humansHomo sapiens. Researchers perform extensive\nbasic research in model organisms because they can apply the information to genetically similar organisms. Amodel organism\nis a species that researchers use as a model to understand the biological processes in other species that the model organism\nrepresents. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The process of\nattaching biological information to gene sequences isgenome annotation. Annotating gene sequences helps with basic\nexperiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through each genome sequencing step at thissite(http://openstax.org/l/DNA_sequence).\nGenome Sequence Uses\nDNA microarraysare methods that scientists use to detect gene expression by analyzing different DNA fragments that are fixed\nto a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and sequences.

Many fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial\ngenomics are using genomics. Understanding and finding cures for diseases is the most common application of genomics.\nPredicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level\nPredicting disease risk involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Health care\nprofessionals can recommend intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs before disease onset. However, this approach is\nmost applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of\ndiseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored orpolygenic, which is a\nphenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010,\nscientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford\nUniversity, who had his genome sequenced. The analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. The medical team\nperformed a risk assessment to analyze Quake\u2019s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. The team found a rare\ngenetic mutation, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. The results also predicted that Quake had a 23 percent\nrisk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. The scientists used databases and several\npublications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools\nare becoming more reliable, researchers still must address ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 455 ---",

ThePCA3test is a better indicator of cancer than the more well known PSA test, which measures\nthe level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.\nIn 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for\nprostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate\ncancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side\neffects. ThePCA3test is more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer\nitself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men receive prostate cancer screenings using\nthePCA3or PSA test? Should people in general receive screenings to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other\ndiseases?\nPharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics\nPharmacogenomics, or toxicogenomics, involves evaluating drug effectiveness and safety on the basis of information from an\nindividual's genomic sequence. We can study genomic responses to drugs using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats\nor mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could\nprovide information about the transcription profile in the drug's presence, which we can use as an early indicator of the\npotential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to\ncancerous cell growth. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Medical professionals can\nuse personal genome sequence information to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of\nthe individual patient\u2019s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but medical professionals can test them\nfurther before pathologic symptoms arise.\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\nTraditionally, scholars have taught microbiology with the view that it is best to study microorganisms underpure culture\nconditions. This involves isolating a single cell type and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through\nseveral generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In\naddition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist culturing in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities,\nbut in microbial communities or biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study\nmicroorganisms.Metagenomicsis the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an\nenvironmental niche.

Amino acids comprise proteins\nand play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of\nreactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help\ntransport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state,\nprotein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.\nAproteomeis the entire set of proteins that a cell type produces. We can study proteoms using the knowledge of genomes\nbecause genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction, not all\nmRNAs are translated into proteins.Proteomicsis the study of proteomes' function. Proteomics complements genomics and is\nuseful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that they based on genes. Even though all multicellular organisms' cells have\nthe same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the\ngenome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced\n(cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins modify themselves after translation by\nprocesses such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein\ninteractions, which complicate studying proteomes. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends\non several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.\nMetabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics.Metabolomicsinvolves studying small molecule metabolites in an\norganism. Themetabolomeis the complete set of metabolites that are related to an organism's genetic makeup. Metabolomics\noffers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental\nfactors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all the metabolites in living organisms' tissues\nand fluids.\nBasic Techniques in Protein Analysis\nThe ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions,\nstudy the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. Just as\nscientists analyze the genome using the basic DNA sequencing technique, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis.\nThe basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry identifies and\ndetermines a molecule's characteristics. Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small protein\nsamples. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine a protein crystal's three-dimensional structure at\natomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), uses atoms' magnetic properties to\ndetermine the protein's three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution. Scientists have also used protein microarrays to study\nprotein interactions. Large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.17) have provided the basis for protein\nmicroarrays. Scientists use computer software to analyze the vast amount of data for proteomic analysis.\nGenomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part ofsystems biology, which is the study of whole biological systems (genomes\nand proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome\nOrganization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data.\nBecause proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to\ncompare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes. Most pharmaceutical\ndrug trials target proteins.

Scientists,\nphilosophers, researchers, and others had made suggestions and debated this topic well before Darwin\nbegan to explore this idea. Classical Greek philosopher Plato emphasized in his writings that species were\nstatic and unchanging, yet there were also ancient Greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas. In the\neighteenth century, naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon reintroduced ideas about the\nevolution of animals and observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal\npopulations, even when the environments are similar. Some at this time also accepted that there were\nextinct species.\nAlso during the eighteenth century, James Hutton, a Scottish geologist and naturalist, proposed that\ngeological change occurred gradually by accumulating small changes from processes operating like they are\ntoday over long periods of time. This contrasted with the predominant view that the planet's geology was a\nconsequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past. Nineteenth century geologist\nCharles Lyell popularized Hutton's view. A friend to Darwin. Lyell\u2019s ideas were influential on Darwin\u2019s\nthinking: Lyell\u2019s notion of the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the\nprocess of change provided an analogy for this change. In the early nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste\nLamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change. We now refer to this\nmechanism as an inheritance of acquired characteristics by which the environment causes modifications in\nan individual, or offspring could use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, and thus bring about change\nin a species. While many discredited this mechanism for evolutionary change, Lamarck\u2019s ideas were an\nimportant influence on evolutionary thought.\nCharles Darwin and Natural Selection\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, two naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, independently\nconceived and described the actual mechanism for evolution. Importantly, each naturalist spent time\nexploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the\nworld onH.M.S. Beagle, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace\ntraveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago\nfrom 1854 to 1862. Darwin\u2019s journey, like Wallace\u2019s later journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at\nseveral island chains, the last being the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands west of Ecuador. On these islands, Darwin\nobserved species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. For\nexample, the ground finches inhabiting the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak\nshape (Figure 18.2). The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small\ndifferences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species\non the South American mainland. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from\none of the original mainland species. Upon further study, he realized that each finch's varied beaks helped\nthe birds acquire a specific type of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for\nbreaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 465 ---",

He postulated that ancestral species' beaks had adapted over\ntime to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.\nWallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation\nfor how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection.Natural selection, or \u201csurvival\nof the fittest,\u201d is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of\nthose traits. This leads to evolutionary change.\nFor example, Darwin observed a population of giant tortoises in the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago to have longer necks than those that\nlived on other islands with dry lowlands. These tortoises were \u201cselected\u201d because they could reach more leaves and access more\nfood than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves\nhad a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn\u2019t reach the food source. Consequently, long-necked tortoises would\nbe more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring. Over time, only long-necked\ntortoises would be present in the population.\nNatural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most\ncharacteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and Wallace,\nknew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than are able to\nsurvive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the\navailability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation.

Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those\nvariations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best\ncompete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to\ncompete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to\nchange in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection\nleads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment. It is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.\nIn 1858, Darwin and Wallace (Figure 18.3) presented papers at the Linnean Society in London that discussed the idea of natural\nselection.

                "text": "\u2022 Understanding Evolution 447\nFigure18.4A field biologist tranquilizes a polar bear for study. (credit: Karen Rhode)\nOne objective of many field biologists includes discovering new, unrecorded species. Not only do such findings expand our\nunderstanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important innovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture. Plant\nand microbial species, in particular, can reveal new medicinal and nutritive knowledge. Other organisms can play key roles in\necosystems or if rare require protection. When discovered, researchers can use these important species as evidence for\nenvironmental regulations and laws.\nProcesses and Patterns of Evolution\nNatural selection can only take place if there isvariation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these\ndifferences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical\nbecause nongenetic reasons can cause variation among individuals such as an individual's height because of better nutrition\nrather than different genes.\nGenetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in\nDNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes that mutation causes\ncan have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation affects the organism's phenotype in a way that gives it reduced\nfitness\u2014lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness.\nMany mutations will also have no effect on the phenotype's fitness. We call these neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a\nwhole range of effect sizes on the organism's fitness that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect.\nSexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to\nproduce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring.\nWe call a heritable trait that helps an organism's survival and reproduction in its present environment anadaptation. Scientists\ndescribe groups of organisms adapting to their environment when a genetic variation occurs over time that increases or\nmaintains the population's \u201cfit\u201d to its environment. A platypus's webbed feet are an adaptation for swimming. A snow leopard's\nthick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. A cheetah's fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.\nWhether or not a trait is favorable depends on the current environmental conditions. The same traits are not always selected\nbecause environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a plant species that grew in a moist climate and did not\nneed to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun. Large\nleaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support\nlarge leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water. The direction of natural\nselection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive\nthe new environmental conditions.\nThe evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of\norganisms that become tremendously different from each other. We call two species that evolve in diverse directions from a\n\n--- Page 468 ---\n448",

Nevertheless, the\ntheory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThissite(http://openstax.org/l/misconceptions)addresses some of the main misconceptions associated with the theory of\nevolution.\nEvolution Is Just a Theory\nCritics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word \u201ctheory\u201d\nwith the way scientists use the word. In science, we understand a \u201ctheory\u201d to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified\nexplanations for a set of observations of the natural world. Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the\ntheory of relativity, each which describes understood facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of evolution describes\nfacts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists. In contrast,\na \u201ctheory\u201d in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation. This meaning is more akin to the\nscientific concept of \u201chypothesis.\u201d When critics of evolution say it is \u201cjust a theory,\u201d they are implying that there is little evidence\nsupporting it and that it is still in the process of rigorous testing. This is a mischaracterization.\nIndividuals Evolve\nEvolution is the change in a population's genetic composition over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential\nreproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is development and\ninvolves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual\u2019s\nenvironment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average\nvalue of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium\nground finches in the Gal\u00e1pagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. If one measures the\naverage bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures them in the population several years\nlater, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. Although some individuals may survive from the first time to\nthe second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals who contribute to the shift in\naverage bill size.\nEvolution Explains the Origin of Life\nIt is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life\u2019s origins. Conversely, some of the theory\u2019s critics\nbelieve that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of evolution\nexplains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. It does not shed light on the beginnings\nof life including the origins of the first cells, which define life.

Scientists call such organisms members of the same\nbiological species.\nSpecies and the Ability to Reproduce\nAspeciesis a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. According to this definition,\none species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species\nto produce fertile offspring.\nMembers of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA. The closer\nrelationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People\u2019s DNA is likely\nto be more like their father or mother\u2019s DNA than their cousin or grandparent\u2019s DNA. Organisms of the same species have the\nhighest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction.\nSpecies\u2019 appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic dogs\n(Canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce\nviable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (Figure 18.9).\nFigure18.9The (a) poodle and (b) cocker spaniel can reproduce to produce a breed known as (c) the cockapoo. (credit a: modification of\nwork by Sally Eller, Tom Reese; credit b: modification of work by Jeremy McWilliams; credit c: modification of work by Kathleen Conklin)\nIn other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though\nbald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a\nseparate species group (Figure 18.10). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize a bald eagle's egg with an African fish\neagle's sperm and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called ahybrid(a cross between two species), would probably be\ninfertile\u2014unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active\nin development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions.

Again, the basis to any changes in a\ngroup or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. When variations occur\nwithin a species, they can only pass to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual\nreproduction. The change will pass on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. For the changed trait\nto pass on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait. In other words,\nsexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a\nsperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore,\nreproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. In short, organisms must be able\nto reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.\nSpeciation\nThe biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actual or potential\ninterbreeding individuals. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible\nand may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. The presence in nature of hybrids\nbetween similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process\nmay not yet be completed.\nGiven the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms forspeciation: the formation of two species\nfrom one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only\nillustration inOn theOrigin of Species(Figure 18.11a). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution (Figure\n18.11), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as\nthe population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.\nFigure18.11The only illustration in Darwin'sOn the Origin of Speciesis (a) a diagram showing speciation events leading to biological\ndiversity. The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that today illustrate the relationships of species. (b) Modern elephants\n\n--- Page 474 ---\n454",

Individual organisms will mate with any\nnearby individual with whom they are capable of breeding. We call an area where two closely related species continue to interact\nand reproduce, forming hybrids ahybrid zone. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids\nand the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.22). If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, speciation reinforcement occurs, and the\nspecies continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion\noccurs and the two species become one.

Reinforcement, fusion, or stability may result, depending on reproductive barriers and the relative fitness of the\nhybrids.\nIf two species eat a different diet but one of the food sources is eliminated and both species are forced to eat the same foods,\nwhat change in the hybrid zone is most likely to occur?\nHybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such\nreproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process we callreinforcement. Scientists use\nthis term because the hybrids' low success reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents,\nthe two species may fuse back into one species (Figure 18.23). Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will\nremain separate but also continue to interact to produce some individuals. Scientists classify this as stability because no real net\nchange is taking place.\nVarying Rates of Speciation\nScientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the fossil\nrecord. As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models to help explain\nspeciation rates. In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, we can observe two current patterns: gradual speciation model and\npunctuated equilibrium model.\nIn thegradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. In thepunctuated equilibriummodel, a\nnew species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time\nafterward (Figure 18.23). We call this early change model punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or\nperiodic change and then remains in balance afterward. While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not\nnecessarily exclude gradualism.\n\n--- Page 482 ---\n462",

A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.\nThe allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become\nmore widespread than others during the natural selection process. Natural selection can alter the population\u2019s genetic makeup.\nAn example is if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. Because\nmany of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more\noffspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the\npopulation. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the\nallele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. Thegene\npoolis the sum of all the alleles in a population.\nSometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele\nfrequencies. We call this phenomenon genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in\npopulations and are not isolated events.

We call an event that initiates an allele frequency change\nin an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, thefounder effect. Natural selection,\nrandom drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in a population's genome.\nHardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium\nIn the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated the\nprinciple of equilibrium to describe the population's genetic makeup. The theory, which later became known as the Hardy-\nWeinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a population\u2019s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable\u2014 unless some\nkind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change. The\nHardy-Weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against\ngenotype, plus an infinite population. While no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model\nagainst which to compare real population changes.\nWorking under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical\nmodels. The variable p, for example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say Y for the trait of yellow in Mendel\u2019s\npeas, while the variable q represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color green. If these are the only two possible\nalleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles comprise all of the alleles\nfor that locus in the population.\nHowever, what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting\ngenotypes, known as the population\u2019sgenetic structure, from which scientists can surmise phenotype distribution. If we\nobserve the phenotype, we can know only the homozygous recessive allele's genotype. The calculations provide an estimate of the\nremaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if we know the allele frequencies (p and q), predicting\nthe genotypes' frequencies is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability of obtaining these genotypes if we\ndraw two alleles at random from the gene pool. In the above scenario, an individual pea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce\nyellow peas; pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus produce green peas (Figure 19.2).

As a result, the population's genetic makeup can change dramatically. We call this\nphenomenon the bottleneck effect.\nHypothesis:Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each time one runs this\nexperiment the results will vary.\nTest the hypothesis:Count out the original population using different colored beads. For example, red, blue, and yellow beads\nmight represent red, blue, and yellow individuals. After recording the number of each individual in the original population,\nplace them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a few beads out at a time. Then, pour 1/3 of the bottle\u2019s contents\ninto a bowl. This represents the surviving individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. Count the\nnumber of the different colored beads in the bowl, and record it. Then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the\nexperiment four more times.\nAnalyze the data:Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment. Do the populations all contain the same\nnumber of different colored beads, or do they vary? Remember, these populations all came from the same exact parent\npopulation.\nForm a conclusion:Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically. This is because natural disasters are\nnot selective\u2014they kill and spare individuals at random. Now think about how this might affect a real population. What\nhappens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast? How do the seabirds that live on the beach fare?\nGene Flow\nAnother important evolutionary force isgene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of\nindividuals or gametes (Figure 19.6). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants, for\nexample, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some distance\naway. Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share of\nimmigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated females.\nThis variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the population's gene structure, but it can also\nintroduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats.\nFigure19.6Gene flow can occur when an individual travels from one geographic location to another.\nMutation\nMutations are changes to an organism\u2019s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve because of\nmutations accumulating over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and\nphenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural\nselection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is\ndetermined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and\ncan linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting\nphenotype.\n\n--- Page 496 ---\n476",

                "text": "\u2022 Adaptive Evolution 477\nselection acts at the individual's level. It selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next\ngeneration. Scientists call this an organism\u2019sevolutionary (Darwinian) fitness.\nFitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. However, it is not an individual's absolute fitness that\ncounts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. Scientists call this conceptrelative fitness, which\nallows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how\nthe population might evolve.\nThere are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying\nselection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a\npopulation, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes can become more similar or more\ndisparate.\nStabilizing Selection\nIf natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergostabilizing\nselection(Figure 19.8). In a mouse population that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor mice that\nbest blend in with the forest floor and are less likely for predators to spot. Assuming the ground is a fairly consistent shade of\nbrown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their\ngenes for their brown coat. Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker will stand out against the ground\nand be more likely to fall victim to predation. As a result of this selection, the population\u2019s genetic variance will decrease.\nDirectional Selection\nWhen the environment changes, populations will often undergodirectional selection(Figure 19.8), which selects for phenotypes\nat one end of the spectrum of existing variation. A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth\nin eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were predominately light in color,\nwhich allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment. However, as soot began spewing\nfrom factories, the trees darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot. Over time, the\nfrequency of the moth's melanic form increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution\nbecause their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees. Similarly, the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on\na different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color. The result of this type of\nselection is a shift in the population\u2019s genetic variance toward the new, fit phenotype.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn science, we sometimes believe some things are true, and then new information becomes available that changes our\nunderstanding. The peppered moth story is an example: some scientists recently have questioned the facts behind the selection\ntoward darker moths. Read thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/peppered_moths)to learn more.\nDiversifying Selection\nSometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages for natural selection, while the intermediate\nphenotypes are, on average, less fit. Scientists call thisdiversifying selection(Figure 19.8) We see this in many animal\npopulations that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males use brute force to obtain mates, while small males can\nsneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male\u2019s territory. In this case, both the alpha males and the\n\u201csneaking\u201d males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, who can\u2019t overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak\ncopulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either\nend of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a mouse population living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed\nwith patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-\ncolored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, alternatively would not blend in with either the grass or the sand,\nand thus predators would most likely eat them. The result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population\nbecomes more diverse.\n\n--- Page 498 ---\n478",

Blue males will thrive when\nthe population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are the most populous. As a\nresult, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes\u2014in one generation, orange might\npredominate, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. Once yellow males comprise a majority of the population,\nblue males will be selected.

A phylogeny describes the organisim's relationships, such as from which organisms it may have\nevolved, or to which species it is most closely related. Phylogenetic relationships provide information on\nshared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different.\nPhylogenetic Trees\nScientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among\norganisms. Aphylogenetic treeis a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or\ngroups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since\none cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, we can construct a \u201ctree of life\u201d to\nillustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms\n(Figure 20.2).\nUnlike a taxonomic classification diagram, we can read a phylogenetic tree like a map of evolutionary\nhistory. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor.\nScientists call such treesrooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the\nbottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic\ntree that the three domains\u2014 Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya\u2014diverge from a single point and branch off.\nThe small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and\nminiscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees do not show a common ancestor\nbut do show relationships among species.\nFigure20.2Both of these phylogenetic trees show the relationship of the three domains of life\u2014Bacteria, Archaea,\nand Eukarya\u2014but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor\nwhile the (b) unrooted tree does not. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Gaba)\nIn a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships (Figure 20.3). The point where a split\noccurs, abranch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. We call a lineage\nthat evolved early from the root that remains unbranched abasal taxon. We call two lineages stemming\nfrom the same branch pointsister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is apolytomyand serves to\nillustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships. Note that although sister\ntaxa and polytomy do share an ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from\neach other. Organisms in two taxa may have split at a specific branch point, but neither taxon gave rise to the\nother.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 507 ---",

A branch point indicates\nwhere two lineages diverged. A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal taxon. When two lineages stem from the same\nbranch point, they are sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy.\nThe diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. We can trace the pathway from the origin of\nlife to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a\nsingle species and tracing back towards the \"trunk\" of the tree, one can discover species' ancestors, as well as where lineages\nshare a common ancestry. In addition, we can use the tree to study entire groups of organisms.\nAnother point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For\nexample, if a branch point rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because each taxon's\nevolution from the branch point was independent of the other.\nMany disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these\ndisciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the \u201ctree of life.\u201dSystematicsis the field that scientists\nuse to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships.

If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings, it is possible for the two groups to appear\nmore different than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree inFigure 20.4shows that\nlizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs; whereas, frogs do not.

Similar to\ndetective work, scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts. In the case of phylogeny, evolutionary investigations focus on\ntwo types of evidence: morphologic (form and function) and genetic.\nTwo Options for Similarities\nIn general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes are more closely related than those that do not. We refer\nto such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically as homologous structures. They stem from\ndevelopmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in bat and bird wings have homologous\nstructures (Figure 20.7).\nFigure20.7Bat and bird wings are homologous structures, indicating that bats and birds share a common evolutionary past.

Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. This\nusually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions.\nWhen similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is\nananalogyor homoplasy.

The phylogenetic tree concept with a single trunk representing a common ancestor, with the branches\nrepresenting the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure of many common trees, such as the oak\n(Figure 20.12b).

The double\nmembrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second membrane from the\nhost as it was internalized. Scientists have also used this mechanism to explain the double membranes in mitochondria and\nchloroplasts. Lake\u2019s work is not without skepticism, and the biological science community still debates his ideas. In addition to\nLake\u2019s hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin of eukaryotes. How did the eukaryotic nucleus\nevolve? One theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome.\nSome bacteria have the DNA enclosed by two membranes; however, there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores. Other\nproteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes. If the eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of\nthe two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to eukaryotes.\nFigure20.14The scientific community now widely accepts the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are endosymbiotic in origin. More\ncontroversial is the proposal that (a) the eukaryotic nucleus resulted from fusing archaeal and bacterial genomes, and that (b) Gram-\nnegative bacteria, which have two membranes, resulted from fusing Archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, each of which has a single\nmembrane.\nThenucleus-firsthypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first (Figure 20.15a), followed by a later fusion of\nthe new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria. Themitochondria-firsthypothesis proposes that mitochondria\nwere first established in a prokaryotic host (Figure 20.15b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion or other\nmechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell. Most interestingly, theeukaryote-firsthypothesis proposes that prokaryotes\nactually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity (Figure 20.15c). All of these hypotheses are testable. Only time\nand more experimentation will determine which hypothesis data best supports.\n\n--- Page 520 ---\n500",

(credit b: modification of work by\n\"psyberartist\"/Flickr)\nRing of Life Models\nOthers have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called \u201cring of life\u201d\n(Figure 20.17). This is a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes. Lake,\nagain using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three\ndomains\u2014Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya\u2014evolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes. His laboratory proposes\nthat this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the ring model is\nthe only one that adequately takes HGT and genomic fusion into account. However, other phylogeneticists remain highly\nskeptical of this model.\nFigure20.17According to the \u201cring of life\u201d phylogenetic model, the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.\nIn summary, we must modify Darwin's \u201ctree of life\u201d model to include HGT. Does this mean abandoning the tree model\ncompletely? Even Lake argues that scientists should attempt to modify the tree model to allow it to accurately fit his data, and\nonly the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships of life.\nA consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwin\u2019s original phylogenetic tree concept is too\nsimple, but made sense based on what scientists knew at the time. However, the search for a more useful model moves on: each\nmodel serves as hypotheses to test with the possibility of developing new models. This is how science advances. Researchers use\nthese models as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships and understand the massive amount of\ndata that requires analysis.\n\n--- Page 522 ---\n502",

When exploring the evolutionary history of most\norganisms, scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence. However, viruses do not fossilize, as far as we\nknow, so researchers must extrapolate from investigations of how today\u2019s viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic\ninformation to create speculative virus histories.\nMost scholars agree that viruses don\u2019t have a single common ancestor, nor is there a single reasonable hypothesis about virus\norigins. There are current evolutionary scenarios that may explain the origin of viruses. One such hypothesis, the \u201cdevolution\u201d or\ntheregressive hypothesis, suggests that viruses evolved from free-living cells, or from intracellular prokaryotic parasites.\nHowever, many components of how this process might have occurred remain a mystery. A second hypothesis, the escapist or the\nprogressive hypothesis, suggests that viruses originated from RNA and DNA molecules, or self-replicating entities similar to\ntransposons or other mobile genetic elements, that escaped from a host cell with the ability to enter another. A third hypothesis,\nthevirus first hypothesis,suggests that viruses may have been the first self-replicating entities before the first cells. In all cases,\nviruses are probably continuing to evolve along with the cells on which they rely on as hosts.\nAs technology advances, scientists may develop and refine additional hypotheses to explain the origins of viruses. The emerging\nfield called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material. These\nresearchers hope one day to better understand the origin of viruses\u2014a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments\nfor the ailments they produce.\nViral Morphology\nViruses arenoncellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure. They therefore lack most of the\ncomponents of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane. A virion consists of a nucleic acid core, an outer\nprotein coating orcapsid, and sometimes an outerenvelopemade of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the\nhost cell. Viruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes, within the capsid or attached to the viral genome. The\nmost obvious difference between members of different viral families is the variation in their morphology, which is quite diverse.\nAn interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not necessarily correlate with the complexity of\nthe virion. In fact, some of the most complex virion structures are found in thebacteriophages\u2014viruses that infect the simplest\nliving organisms, bacteria.\nMorphology\nViruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these features are consistent for each viral family. As we have seen, all virions have a\nnucleic acid genome covered by a protective capsid. The proteins of the capsid are encoded in the viral genome, and are called\ncapsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple helices or polyhedral \u201cspheres,\u201d whereas others are quite complex in structure\n(Figure 21.3).\n\n--- Page 528 ---\n508",

Non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts\n(papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus).\nEnveloped virions, such as the influenza virus, consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of influenza) and capsid proteins\nsurrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope that contains virus-encoded proteins. Glycoproteins embedded in the viral\nenvelope are used to attach to host cells. Other envelope proteins are thematrix proteinsthat stabilize the envelope and often\nplay a role in the assembly of progeny virions. Chicken pox, HIV, and mumps are other examples of diseases caused by viruses\nwith envelopes.

To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the RNA viruses must\nencode their own enzymes that can replicate RNA into RNA or, in the retroviruses, into DNA. TheseRNA polymerase enzymes\nare more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription. For this\nreason, mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This causes them to change and adapt more\nrapidly to their host. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include influenza, hepatitis C, measles, and rabies. The HIV virus,\nwhich is sexually transmitted, is an RNA retrovirus.\nThe Challenge of Virus Classification\nBecause most viruses probably evolved from different ancestors, the systematic methods that scientists have used to classify\nprokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are not very useful. If viruses represent \u201cremnants\u201d of different organisms, then even genomic\nor protein analysis is not useful. Why?,Because viruses have no common genomic sequence that they all share. For example, the\n16S rRNA sequence so useful for constructing prokaryote phylogenies is of no use for a creature with no ribosomes! Biologists\nhave used several classification systems in the past. Viruses were initially grouped by shared morphology. Later, groups of\nviruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or\ndouble-stranded. However, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, because they were based on\ndifferent sets of characters of the virus. The most commonly used classification method today is called the Baltimore\nclassification scheme, and is based on how messenger RNA (mRNA) is generated in each particular type of virus.\nPast Systems of Classification\nViruses contain only a few elements by which they can be classified: the viral genome, the type of capsid, and the envelope\nstructure for the enveloped viruses. All of these elements have been used in the past for viral classification (Table 21.1andFigure\n21.6). Viral genomes may vary in the type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its organization (single- or double-stranded,\nlinear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented). In some viruses, additional proteins needed for replication are associated\ndirectly with the genome or contained within the viral capsid.\nVirus Classification by Genome Structure\nGenome Structure Examples\nRNA Rabies virus, retroviruses\nDNA Herpesviruses, smallpox virus\nSingle-stranded Rabies virus, retroviruses\nDouble-stranded Herpesviruses, smallpox virus\nRabies virus, retroviruses, herpesviruses, smallpox\nLinear\nvirus\nCircular\nPapillomaviruses, many bacteriophages\nNon-segmented: genome consists of a single segment of genetic\nParainfluenza viruses\nmaterial\nInfluenza viruses\nSegmented: genome is divided into multiple segments\nTable21.1\n\n--- Page 532 ---\n512",

                "text": "\u2022 Virus Infections and Hosts 515\nViruses are obligate, intracellular parasites. A virus must first recognize and attach to a specific living cell prior to entering it.\nAfter penetration, the invading virus must copy its genome and manufacture its own proteins. Finally, the progeny virions must\nescape the host cell so that they can infect other cells. Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within\nthat host. Specific host cells that a virus must occupy and use to replicate are calledpermissive. In most cases, the molecular\nbasis for this specificity is due to a particular surface molecule known as theviral receptoron the host cell surface. A specific\nviral receptor is required for the virus to attach. In addition, differences in metabolism and host-cell immune responses (based\non differential gene expression) are a likely factor in determining which cells a virus may target for replication.\nSteps of Virus Infections\nA virus must use its host-cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural\nchanges in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, calledcytopathic effects, can change cell functions or\neven destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through\nlysis(bursting) orapoptosis(programmed cell death or \u201ccell suicide\u201d), releasing all progeny virions at once. The symptoms of\nviral diseases result both from such cell damage caused by the virus and from the immune response to the virus, which attempts\nto control and eliminate the virus from the body.\nMany animal viruses, such asHIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process\nknown asbudding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is\nnot immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function\nnormally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the\nvirus replication cycle:attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release(Figure 21.8).\nAttachment\nA virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via\nglycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host\u2014and the cells within the\nhost\u2014that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each\nkey will fit only one specific lock.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/influenza)explains how influenza attacks the body.\nEntry\nViruses may enter a host cell either with or without the viral capsid. The nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell\n\u201cnaked,\u201d leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses can enter throughendocytosis(as you may recall, the cell\nmembrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus). Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly\nwith the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid degrades, and then the viral nucleic acid is released and becomes\navailable for replication and transcription.\nReplication and Assembly\nThe replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host-cell proteins and enzymes to replicate\nthe viral DNA and to transcribe viral mRNA, which is then used to direct viral protein synthesis. RNA viruses usually use the\nRNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral\nenzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions.\nOf course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral\ngenes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses, such as HIV (group VI of the Baltimore\nclassification scheme), have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA, which then is incorporated into the\nhost cell genome. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse\ntranscriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells\u2014the\nenzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that HIV\nproduces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes\nwithout affecting the host\u2019s metabolism.\nThis approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number\nof infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many HIV-infected individuals.\n\n--- Page 536 ---\n516",

In bacteriophage with tails, like the one shown\nhere, the tails serve as a passageway for transmission of the phage genome. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Graham Beards; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nMost bacteriophages are dsDNA viruses, which use host enzymes for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Phage particles\nmust bind to specific surface receptors and actively insert the genome into the host cell. (The complex tail structures seen in\nmany bacteriophages are actively involved in getting the viral genome across the prokaryotic cell wall.) When infection of a cell\nby a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to beproductive. If the virions are released by\nbursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of alytic cycle(Figure 21.10). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which\ninfectsEscherichia colifound in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without\nbeing released. For example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of alysogenic cycle\n(Figure 21.10), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into\nthe host-cell genome, it is called aprophage. An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the \u03bb (lambda) virus, which also infects\ntheE.colibacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may sometimes undergo infections where they are not producing\nvirions for long periods. An example is the animalherpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of oral and genital\nherpes in humans. In a process calledlatency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without\nproducing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though\nthere are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages.\nLatency will be described in more detail in the next section.\n\n--- Page 538 ---\n518",

They are responsible\nfor poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. Others viruses may damage\nplants used in landscaping. Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as\ntomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for landscaping, two of the\nmost common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail,\nbut symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants. In the\nornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant.\nAnimal Viruses\nAnimal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell. The\nvirus may even induce the host cell to cooperate in the infection process. Non-enveloped or \u201cnaked\u201d animal viruses may enter\ncells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the\ncell via a vesicle during the normal cell process ofreceptor-mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used\nby non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the\nhost cell membrane. The viral genome is then \u201cinjected\u201d into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that\nused by many bacteriophages.\nEnveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or\nfusion. Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to that seen in some non-\nenveloped viruses. On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among\nothers, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus\nreleasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.\nAfter making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell.\nAs we have already discussed using the example the influenza virus, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane\nas they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell\u2019s plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped\nviral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are\nreleased together.\nAs you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow the\nclassic pattern ofacute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the\nvirus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral diseases are the\ncommon cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-termchronic infections, such as the virus causing hepatitis C, whereas\nothers, like herpes simplex virus, only causeintermittentsymptoms. Still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7,\nwhich in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without\ncausing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have anasymptomatic infection.\nIn hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is so low\n\n--- Page 540 ---\n520",

The concept behind this is that by giving the vaccine,\nimmunity is boosted without adding more disease-causing virus. In the case ofrabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted\nvia the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it\nenters the central nervous system may be two weeks or longer. This is enough time to vaccinate individuals who suspect that\nthey have been bitten by a rabid animal, and their boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the virus from entering\nnervous tissue. Thus, the potentially fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted, and the individual only has to\nrecover from the infected bite. This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly\nviruses on Earth. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 70 to 90 percent of infected humans within\ntwo weeks. Using newly developed vaccines thatboost the immune responsein this way, there is hope that affected individuals\nwill be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected persons from a rapid and very painful\ndeath.\nAnother way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. Because viruses use the resources of the host cell for\nreplication and the production of new virus proteins, it is difficult to block their activities without damaging the host. However,\nwe do have some effective antiviral drugs, such as those used to treat HIV and influenza. Some antiviral drugs are specific for a\nparticular virus and others have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For most viruses,\nthese drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins.It is important to note that the targeted\nproteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell.In this way, viral growth is\ninhibited without damaging the host.\nAntivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex II) and influenza. For genital herpes, drugs such as\nacyclovir can reduce the number and duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in\ntheir skin cells. As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the\nsymptoms of the disease more manageable. For influenza, drugs like Tamiflu (oseltamivir) (Figure 21.15) can reduce the duration\nof \u201cflu\u201d symptoms by one or two days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Tamiflu works by inhibiting an enzyme\n(viral neuraminidase) that allows new virions to leave their infected cells. Thus, Tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from\n\n--- Page 544 ---\n524",

The disease was spread by the consumption of meat,\nnervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species.

Kuru was\ncontrolled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism.\nOn the other hand, BSE was initially thought to only affect cattle. Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed\nlesions or \u201choles\u201d in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge. Later on in the outbreak, however, it was shown\nthat a similar encephalopathy in humans, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), could be acquired from eating beef\nfrom animals infected with BSE, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of British beef and causing considerable\neconomic damage to the British beef industry (Figure 21.17). BSE still exists in various areas, and although a rare disease,\nindividuals that acquire CJD are difficult to treat. The disease can be spread from human to human by blood, so many countries\nhave banned blood donation from regions associated with BSE.\nThe cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and BSE, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular protein\ncalled PrP (prion protein). It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle. PrP exists in two forms,PrPc, the normal form of\nthe protein, andPrPsc, the infectious form. Once introduced into the body, the PrPsccontained within the prion binds to PrPc\nand converts it to PrPsc. This leads to an exponential increase of the PrPscprotein, which aggregates. PrPscis folded abnormally,\nand the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains of infected cattle. Thus, although\nnot without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new form of infectious agent, the first one\nfound whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA.\nFigure21.17Mad Cow Disease in humans. (a) Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc)\nwhen it encounters this variant form of the protein. PrPscmay arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form of the protein\nis present, or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in food into brain tissue.

Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified.\nViroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.18) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars in\nagricultural revenue each year.

What were the conditions on Earth when life began? We now know\nthat prokaryotes were likely the first forms of cellular life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years\nbefore plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are dated at about 4.54billion years in age. This\nestimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate\nmaterial from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular\noxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong solar radiation; thus, the first organisms probably\nwould have flourished where they were more protected, such as in the deep ocean or far beneath the surface\nof the Earth. Strong volcanic activity was common on Earth at this time, so it is likely that these first\norganisms\u2014the first prokaryotes\u2014were adapted to very high temperatures. Because early Earth was prone\nto geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from\nthe sun, the first organisms were prokaryotes that must have withstood these harsh conditions.\nMicrobial Mats\nMicrobial matsor large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of prokaryotic life on Earth; there is fossil\nevidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago. It is remarkable that cellular life appeared on\nEarth only a billion years after the Earth itself formed, suggesting that pre-cellular \u201clife\u201d that could replicate\nitself had evolved much earlier. Amicrobial matis a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that\nincludes mostly bacteria, but also archaeans. Microbial mats are only a few centimeters thick, and they\ntypically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. The various types of\nprokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their\nvarious colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they\nsecrete calledextracellular matrix.\nThe first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A\nhydrothermal ventis a breakage or fissure in the Earth\u2019s surface that releases geothermally heated water.\nWith the evolution of photosynthesis about three billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats\ncame to use a more widely available energy source\u2014sunlight\u2014whereas others were still dependent on\nchemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 557 ---",

In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters\nare non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under\nlaboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?\nMicrobiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of\nprokaryotes, e.g., 16S rRNA genes, demonstrating their existence. (Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment\nin a process called amplification.)\nThe Ecology of Biofilms\nSome prokaryotes may be unculturable because they require the presence of other prokaryotic species. Until a couple of decades\nago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart. This model, however, does not reflect the true\necology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact. As we have seen, abiofilmis a\nmicrobial community (Figure 22.8) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides\nsecreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. Biofilms typically grow attached to surfaces. Some of\nthe best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described, as well as some\ncomposed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria.\nBiofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial settings.\nIn recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role. They also colonize\nhousehold surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human body, such as the\nsurfaces of our teeth.\nInteractions among the organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protectiveexopolysaccharidic (EPS)\nenvironment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. The sticky substance that holds\nbacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their planktonic\ncounterparts. Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of sterilization.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure22.8Development of a biofilm. Five stages of biofilm development are shown. During stage 1, initial attachment, bacteria adhere to\na solid surface via weakvan der Waals interactions(forces produced by induced electrical interactions between atoms). During stage 2,\nirreversible attachment, hairlike appendages calledpilipermanently anchor the bacteria to the surface. During stage 3, maturation I, the\nbiofilm grows through cell division and recruitment of other bacteria. An extracellular matrix composed primarily of polysaccharides holds\nthe biofilm together. During stage 4, maturation II, the biofilm continues to grow and takes on a more complex shape. During stage 5,\ndispersal, the biofilm matrix is partly broken down, allowing some bacteria to escape and colonize another surface. Micrographs of a\nPseudomonas aeruginosabiofilm in each of the stages of development are shown. (credit: D. Davis, Don Monroe, PLoS)\nCompared to free-floating bacteria, bacteria in biofilms often show increased resistance to antibiotics and detergents.

The name \"prokaryote\" suggests that prokaryotes are\ndefined by exclusion\u2014they are not eukaryotes, or organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other internal membrane-bound\norganelles. However, all cells have four common structures: the plasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and\nseparates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a complex solution of organic molecules and salts inside the cell; a\ndouble-stranded DNA genome, the informational archive of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place.\nProkaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories:cocci(spherical),bacilli(rod-shaped), andspirilli\n(spiral-shaped) (Figure 22.9).\nFigure22.9Common prokaryotic cell types. Prokaryotes fall into three basic categories based on their shape, visualized here using\nscanning electron microscopy: (a) cocci, or spherical (a pair is shown); (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilli, or spiral-shaped.

Their chromosome\u2014usually single\u2014consists of a piece of circular, double-stranded DNA located in an\narea of the cell called thenucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane. Thecell wallfunctions as a\nprotective layer, and it is responsible for the organism\u2019s shape. Some bacterial species have a capsule outside the cell wall. The\ncapsule enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells, and makes\npathogens more resistant to our immune responses. Some species also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion,\nand pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces including the surfaces of other cells. Plasmids, which consist of extra-\nchromosomal DNA, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 563 ---",

Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and Eukarya in two ways.\nFirst, they have branched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones. Second, an ether bond instead of an ester bond connects the lipid to\nthe glycerol.\nThe Cell Wall of Prokaryotes\nThe cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. Therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell\nis relatively high. The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity. It is located\noutside the cell membrane and preventsosmotic lysis(bursting due to increasing volume). The chemical composition of the cell\nwall varies between Archaea and Bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species.\nBacterial cell walls containpeptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides\ncontaining both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. (Proteins normally have only L-amino acids; as\na consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell-\nwall development.) There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan.S-layer (surface layer) proteinsare also present on\nthe outside of cell walls of both Archaea and Bacteria.\nBacteria are divided into two major groups:Gram positiveandGram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining. Note\nthat all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias, Spirochetes,\nCyanobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative. The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish scientist Hans\nChristian Gram (1853\u20131938). The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure.\nGram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms(Figure 22.16). Up to 90 percent\nof the cell-wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances\ncalledteichoic acids. Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to formlipoteichoic acids.\nLipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall composed of\na few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded by an outer envelope containing\nlipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins. This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as a second lipid bilayer. The chemistry\nof this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes.\n\n--- Page 568 ---\n548",

(Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote is a single,\ncircular chromosome.) Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis; instead, the chromosome is replicated and the two resulting copies\nseparate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator and the\ntwo resulting cells, which areclones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or\ngenetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms.\nIntransformation, the prokaryote takes in DNA shed by other prokaryotes into its environment. If a nonpathogenic bacterium\ntakes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome, it too may become\npathogenic. Intransduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, may move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from\none bacterium to another. Transduction results in arecombinant organism. Archaea also have viruses that may translocate\ngenetic material from one individual to another. Inconjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means\nof apilus, which brings the organisms into contact with one another, and provides a channel for transfer of DNA. The DNA\ntransferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a composite molecule, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA. These\nthree processes of DNA exchange are shown inFigure 22.17.\nReproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species. This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of genetic\nrecombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to\nenvironmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly.\n\n--- Page 570 ---\n550",

In many cases, a prokaryote may be placed into a species clade by its defining\nmetabolic features: Can it metabolize lactose? Can it grow on citrate? Does it produce H S? Does it ferment carbohydrates to\n2\nproduce acid and gas? Can it grow under anaerobic conditions? Since metabolism and metabolites are the product of enzyme\npathways, and enzymes are encoded in genes, the metabolic capabilities of a prokaryote are a reflection of its genome. There are\nmany different environments on Earth with various energy and carbon sources, and variable conditions to which prokaryotes\nmay be able to adapt. Prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment from deep-water volcanic vents to Antarctic ice by\nusing whatever energy and carbon sources are available. Prokaryotes fill many niches on Earth, including involvement in\nnitrogen and carbon cycles, photosynthetic production of oxygen, decomposition of dead organisms, and thriving as parasitic,\ncommensal, or mutualistic organisms inside multicellular organisms, including humans. The very broad range of environments\nthat prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have diverse metabolic processes.\nNeeds of Prokaryotes\nThe diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients,\nacidity, salinity, oxygen availability, and energy sources. Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast\narray of nutrients and environmental conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some\nadditional nutrients.\nMacronutrients\nCells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced by the\npolymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain\nsubstances, collectively callednutrients. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they must obtain their nutrients from the\nenvironment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are calledmacronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or\ntrace amounts are calledmicronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients\u2014carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,\nnitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronymCHONPS.)\nWhy are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including\nwater. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other\ncompounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. In contrast, nitrogen represents only 12\npercent of the total dry weight of a typical cell. Nitrogen is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents.\nMost of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N ) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N ) nitrogen,\n2 2\nhowever, can be converted into an organic form only by certain microorganisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both\nhydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the\nsynthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine,\nand is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg),\ncalcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the\nstructure and function of the prokaryotic cell.\nMicronutrients\nIn addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred to as\nmicronutrients or trace elements. For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in electron-\ntransport reactions. Some prokaryotes require other elements\u2014such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese\n(Mn)\u2014primarily as enzyme cofactors.\nThe Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy\nProkaryotes are classified both by the way they obtain energy, and by the carbon source they use for producing organic\nmolecules. These categories are summarized inTable 22.3. Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to generate the ATP\nneeded for biosynthesis and other cellular activities.Phototrophs(or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from\nsunlight. Phototrophs trap the energy of light using chlorophylls, or in a few cases, bacterial rhodopsin. (Rhodopsin-using\nphototrophs, oddly, are phototrophic, but not photosynthetic, since they do not fix carbon.)Chemotrophs(or chemosynthetic\n\n--- Page 572 ---\n552",

Carbon is cycled through\nEarth\u2019s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass. In a way, the carbon\ncycle echoes the role of the \u201cfour elements\u201d first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher, Empedocles: fire, water, earth, and\nair. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere\nvia the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon\nreservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available.\nParticipants in the carbon cycle are roughly divided among producers, consumers, and decomposers of organic carbon\ncompounds. Theprimary producersof organic carbon compounds from CO are land plants and photosynthetic bacteria. A\n2\nlarge amount of available carbon is found in living land plants. A related source of carbon compounds ishumus, which is a\nmixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. (The term \"humus,\" by the\nway, is the root of the word \"human.\") Consumers such as animals and other heterotrophs use organic compounds generated by\nproducers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Other bacteria and fungi, collectively calleddecomposers, carry out\nthe breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds. Most carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is\nderived from the respiration of microorganisms that decompose dead animals, plants, and humus.\nIn aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is based\non one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH ). This methane moves\n4\ninto the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria calledmethane oxidizersthat oxidize\nmethane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.\nFigure22.18The carbon cycle. Prokaryotes play a significant role in continuously moving carbon through the biosphere. (credit:\nmodification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nProkaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle\nNitrogen is a very important element for life because it is a major constituent of proteins and nucleic acids.

Unfortunately, the tenancy of some species can have harmful\neffects and cause disease. Bacteria or other infectious agents that cause harm to their human hosts are calledpathogens.\nDevastating pathogen-borne diseases and plagues, both viral and bacterial in nature, have affected humans and their ancestors\nfor millions of years. The true cause of these diseases was not understood until modern scientific thought developed, and many\npeople thought that diseases were a \u201cspiritual punishment.\u201d Only within the past several centuries have people understood that\nstaying away from afflicted persons, disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness, and sanitation\npractices reduced their own chances of getting sick.\nEpidemiologists study how diseases are transmitted and how they affect a population. Often, they must following the course of\nanepidemic\u2014a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time. In contrast, a\npandemicis a widespread, and usually worldwide, epidemic. Anendemic diseaseis a disease that is always present, usually at\nlow incidence, in a population.\nLong History of Bacterial Disease\nThere are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 B.C. A number of significant pandemics caused by bacteria have\nbeen documented over several hundred years. Some of the most memorable pandemics led to the decline of cities and entire\nnations.\nIn the 21stcentury, infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical\nresearch and treatments in recent decades. A diseasespreadswhen the pathogen that causes it is passed from one person to\nanother. For a pathogen to cause disease, it must be able to reproduce in the host\u2019s body and damage the host in some way.\nThe Plague of Athens\nIn 430 B.C., the Plague of Athens killed one-quarter of the Athenian troops who were fighting in the great Peloponnesian War\nand weakened Athens\u2019s dominance and power. The plague impacted people living in overcrowded Athens as well as troops\naboard ships that had to return to Athens. The source of the plague may have been identified recently when researchers from the\nUniversity of Athens were able to use DNA from teeth recovered from a mass grave. The scientists identified nucleotide\nsequences from a pathogenic bacterium,Salmonella entericaserovar Typhi (Figure 22.20), which causestyphoid fever.3This\ndisease is commonly seen in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded history.\n3Papagrigorakis MJ, Synodinos PN, and Yapijakis C.

Over the centuries, Europeans tended to develop\ngenetic immunity to endemic infectious diseases, but when European conquerors reached the western hemisphere, they\nbrought with them disease-causing bacteria and viruses, which triggered epidemics that completely devastated many diverse\npopulations of Native Americans, who had no natural resistance to many European diseases. It has been estimated that up to 90\npercent of Native Americans died from infectious diseases after the arrival of Europeans, making conquest of the New World a\nforegone conclusion.\nEmerging and Re-emerging Diseases\nThe distribution of a particular disease isdynamic. Changes in the environment, the pathogen, or the host population can\ndramatically impact the spread of a disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemerging disease(Figure\n22.22) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in\nincidence or geographic range. This definition also includesre-emerging diseasesthat were previously under control.\nApproximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases.Zoonosesare\ndiseases that primarily infect animals but can be transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial\norigin. Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, andnecrotizing fasciitis\n(commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons.\n\n--- Page 578 ---\n558",

In the past, it was relatively common to hear about sporadic\ncases of botulism, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacteriumClostridium botulinum. Some\nof the most common sources for this bacterium were non-acidic canned foods, homemade pickles, and processed meat and\nsausages. The can, jar, or package created a suitable anaerobic environment whereClostridiumcould grow. Proper sterilization\nand canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease.\nWhile people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animal-based foods, most cases are now linked to\nproduce. There have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the United States and with\nvegetable sprouts in Germany, and these types of outbreaks have become more common. The raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was\nproduced by the bacteriumE. coliserotype O157:H7. A serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of similar antigens on its\ncell surface, and there are often many different serotypes of a bacterial species. MostE. coliare not particularly dangerous to\nhumans, but serotype O157:H7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal.\nAll types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria. Recent outbreaks ofSalmonellareported by the CDC occurred in\nfoods as diverse as peanut butter, alfalfa sprouts, and eggs. A deadly outbreak in Germany in 2010 was caused byE. coli\ncontamination of vegetable sprouts (Figure 22.24). The strain that caused the outbreak was found to be a new serotype not\npreviously involved in other outbreaks, which indicates thatE. coliis continuously evolving. Outbreaks of listeriosis, due to\ncontamination of meats, raw cheeses, and frozen or fresh vegetables withListeria monocytogenes, are becoming more\nfrequent.\nFigure22.24Foodborne pathogens. (a) Vegetable sprouts grown at an organic farm were the cause of an (b)E. colioutbreak that killed 32\npeople and sickened 3,800 in Germany in 2011. The strain responsible,E. coliO104:H4, produces Shiga toxin, a substance that inhibits\nprotein synthesis in the host cell. The toxin (c) destroys red blood cells resulting in bloody diarrhea. Deformed red blood cells clog the\ncapillaries of the kidney, which can lead to kidney failure, as happened to 845 patients in the 2011 outbreak. Kidney failure is usually\nreversible, but some patients experience kidney problems years later. (credit c: NIDDK, NIH)\nBiofilms and Disease\nRecall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy. They are responsible for diseases such as\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease, otitis media (ear infections), and various infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. They produce dental\nplaque and colonize catheters, prostheses, transcutaneous and orthopedic devices, contact lenses, and internal devices such as\npacemakers. They also form in open wounds and burned tissue. In healthcare environments, biofilms grow on hemodialysis\nmachines, mechanical ventilators, shunts, and other medical equipment. In fact, 65 percent of all infections acquired in the\nhospital (nosocomial infections) are attributed to biofilms. Biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because\nthey colonize the surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat, as well as food-processing equipment that isn\u2019t adequately cleaned.\nBiofilm infections develop gradually and may not cause immediate symptoms. They are rarely resolved by host defense\nmechanisms. Once an infection by a biofilm is established, it is very difficult to eradicate, because biofilms tend to be resistant\nto most methods used to control microbial growth, including antibiotics. The matrix that attaches the cells to a substrate and to\nother another protects the cells from antibiotics or drugs. In addition, since biofilms grow slowly, they are less responsive to\nagents that interfere with cell growth. It has been reported that biofilms can resist up to 1,000 times the antibiotic\nconcentrations used to kill the same bacteria when they are free-living or planktonic. An antibiotic dose that large would harm\nthe patient; therefore, scientists are working on new ways to get rid of biofilms.\n\n--- Page 580 ---\n560",

Some scientists believe that after years of being protected\nfrom bacterial infections by antibiotics, we may be returning to a time in which a simple bacterial infection could again\ndevastate the human population. Researchers are developing new antibiotics, but it takes many years of research and clinical\ntrials, plus financial investments in the millions of dollars, to generate an effective and approved drug.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nEpidemiologist\nEpidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and determinants of health and disease in a population. It is,\ntherefore, part of public health. An epidemiologist studies the frequency and distribution of diseases within human populations\nand environments.\nEpidemiologists collect data about a particular disease and track its spread to identify the original mode of transmission. They\nsometimes work in close collaboration with historians to try to understand the way a disease evolved geographically and over\ntime, tracking the natural history of pathogens. They gather information from clinical records, patient interviews, surveillance,\nand any other available means. That information is used to develop strategies, such as vaccinations (Figure 22.26), and design\npublic health policies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread. Epidemiologists also conduct rapid\ninvestigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it.\nAn epidemiologist has a bachelor\u2019s degree, plus a master\u2019s degree in public health (MPH). Many epidemiologists are also\nphysicians (and have an M.D. or D.O degree), or they have a Ph.D. in an associated field, such as biology or microbiology.\n\n--- Page 582 ---\n562",

More recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our\nmoods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns.

Bioremediation has been\nused to remove agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface.\nCertain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation.\nThe reduction of SeO -2to SeO-2and to Se0(metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury\n4 3\n(Hg) is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. As an active ingredient of\nsome pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production. Methyl\nmercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in\nliving tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These\nbacteria, such asPseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg+2into Hg0, which is nontoxic to humans.\nOne of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil\nspills. The significance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years,\nsuch as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (Figure 22.30), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the\nMediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). In the case of\noil spills in the ocean, ongoing natural bioremediation tends to occur, since there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior\nto the spill. In addition to these naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria, humans select and engineer bacteria that possess\nthe same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed.

Mapping the\ncharacteristics found in all major groups of eukaryotes reveals that the following characteristics are present\nin at least some of the members of each major lineage, or during some part of their life cycle, and therefore\nmust have been present in thelast common ancestor.\n1. Cells with nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope with nuclear pores: This is the single characteristic\nthat is both necessary and sufficient to define an organism as a eukaryote. All extant eukaryotes have\ncells with nuclei.\n2.

Some extant eukaryotes lack flagella and/or\ncilia, but their presence in related lineages suggests that they are descended from ancestors that\npossessed these organelles.\n5. Chromosomes organized by histones: Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a linear DNA molecule\ncoiled around basic (alkaline) proteins called histones. The few eukaryotes with chromosomes lacking\nhistones clearly evolved from ancestors that had them.\n6. Mitosis: A process of nuclear division in which replicated chromosomes are divided and separated\nusing elements of the cytoskeleton. Mitosis is universally present in eukaryotes.\n7. Sexual reproduction: A meiotic process of nuclear division and genetic recombination unique to\neukaryotes.

                "text": "\u2022 Eukaryotic Origins 575\nEndosymbiosis and the Evolution of Eukaryotes\nBefore we discuss the origins of eukaryotes, it is first important to understand that all extant eukaryotes are likely the\ndescendants of a chimera-like organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s) of an alpha-proteobacterium that\n\u201ctook up residence\u201d inside it. This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known asendosymbiosis, one cell engulfing\nanother such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit. Over many generations, a symbiotic relationship can result in\ntwo organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own. Endosymbiotic events likely\ncontributed to the origin of the last common ancestor of today\u2019s eukaryotes and to later diversification in certain lineages of\neukaryotes (Figure 23.5). Similar endosymbiotic associations are not uncommon in living eukaryotes. Before explaining this\nfurther, it is necessary to consider metabolism in prokaryotes.\nProkaryotic Metabolism\nMany important metabolic processes arose in prokaryotes; however, some of these processes, such as nitrogen fixation, are\nnever found in eukaryotes. The process of aerobic respiration is found in all major lineages of eukaryotes, and it is localized in\nthe mitochondria. Aerobic respiration is also found in many lineages of prokaryotes, but it is not present in all of them, and a\ngreat deal of evidence suggests that such anaerobic prokaryotes never carried out aerobic respiration nor did their ancestors.\nWhile today\u2019s atmosphere is about 20 percent molecular oxygen (O ), geological evidence shows that it originally lacked O .\n2 2\nWithout oxygen, aerobic respiration would not be expected, and living things would have relied on anaerobic respiration or the\nprocess of fermentation instead. At some point before about 3.8 billion years ago, some prokaryotes began using energy from\nsunlight to power anabolic processes that reduce carbon dioxide to form organic compounds. That is, they evolved the ability to\nphotosynthesize. Hydrogen, derived from various sources, was \u201ccaptured\u201d using light-powered reactions to reduce fixed carbon\ndioxide in the Calvin cycle. The group of Gram-negative bacteria that gave rise to cyanobacteria used water as the hydrogen\nsource and released O as a \u201cwaste\u201d product.\n2\nEventually, the amount of photosynthetic oxygen built up in some environments to levels that posed a risk to living organisms,\nsince it can damage many organic compounds. Various metabolic processes evolved that protected organisms from oxygen, one\nof which, aerobic respiration, also generated high levels of ATP. It became widely present among prokaryotes, including in a\nfree-living group we now call alpha-proteobacteria. Organisms that did not acquire aerobic respiration had to remain in\noxygen-free environments. Originally, oxygen-rich environments were likely localized around places where cyanobacteria were\nabundant and active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher\nconcentrations in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels similar to today\u2019s levels only arose within the last 700 million years.\nRecall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they seemed to have evolved and\ndiversified rapidly as oxygen levels were increasing. Also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with\nmitochondria. These organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be\nsomewhat worm-shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell. Some early observers suggested that they\nmight be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities.\nEndosymbiotic Theory\nAs cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for\nproducing ATP using aerobic respiration, in which oxygen was the final electron acceptor. In the 1960s, American biologist Lynn\nMargulis of Boston University developed theendosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of\none cell engulfing another, one living within another, and coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer\nrecognizable as such and shared genetic control of a mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce ATP. In 1967, Margulis\nintroduced new data to support her work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence.\nAlthough Margulis\u2019s work initially was met with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now\nwidely accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players\ninvolved.\nWhile the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy-harvesting processes appear to have had their origins in\nbacteria, our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear to be more closely\nrelated to those found in the Archaea. Much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred; this continues to be an\nexciting field of discovery in biology. For instance, it isnotknown whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria\noccurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus. Such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common\nancestor of eukaryotes.\n\n--- Page 596 ---\n576",

Later findings suggest thatreduced organellesare found in most, if not\nall, anaerobic eukaryotes, and that virtually all eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial\norigin.\nIn addition to the aerobic generation of ATP, mitochondria have several other metabolic functions. One of these functions is to\ngenerate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes. Such functions are often associated with the\nreduced mitochondrion-derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes. The protistMonocercomonoides,an inhabitant of\nvertebrate digestive tracts, appears to be an exception; it has no mitochondria and its genome contains neither genes derived\nfrom mitochondria nor nuclear genes related to mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is related to other protists with\nreduced mitochondria and probably represents an end-point in mitochondrial reduction. Although most biologists accept that\nthe last common ancestor of eukaryotes had mitochondria, it appears that the complex relationship between mitochondria and\ntheir host cell continues to evolve.\nPlastids\nSome groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic. Their cells contain, in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles, another\nkind of organelle called aplastid. When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis, their plastids are rich in the pigment\nchlorophyllaand a range of other pigments, calledaccessory pigments, which are involved in harvesting energy from light.\nPhotosynthetic plastids are called chloroplasts (Figure 23.3).\nFigure23.3Chloroplasts. (a) This chloroplast cross-section illustrates its elaborate inner membrane organization. Stacks of thylakoid\nmembranes compartmentalize photosynthetic enzymes and provide scaffolding for chloroplast DNA. (b) In this micrograph ofElodeasp.,\nthe chloroplasts can be seen as small green spheres. (credit b: modification of work by Brandon Zierer; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nLike mitochondria, plastids appear to have an endosymbiotic origin. This hypothesis was also proposed and championed with\nthe first direct evidence by Lynn Margulis. We now know that plastids are derived from cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells\nof an ancestral, aerobic, heterotrophic eukaryote. This is called primary endosymbiosis, and plastids of primary origin are\nsurrounded by two membranes. However, the best evidence is that the acquisition of cyanobacterial endosymbionts has\nhappenedtwicein the history of eukaryotes. In one case, the common ancestor of the major lineage/supergroup Archaeplastida\ntook on a cyanobacterial endosymbiont; in the other, the ancestor of the small amoeboid rhizarian taxon,Paulinella, took on a\ndifferent cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes are descended from the first event, and only a\ncouple of species are derived from the other, which in evolutionary terms, appears to be more recent.\nCyanobacteria are a group of Gram-negative bacteria with all the conventional structures of the group. However, unlike most\nprokaryotes, they have extensive, internal membrane-bound sacs called thylakoids. Chlorophyll is a component of these\nmembranes, as are many of the proteins of the light reactions of photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria also have the peptidoglycan wall\nand lipopolysaccharide layer associated with Gram-negative bacteria.\nChloroplasts of primary endosymbiotic origin have thylakoids, a circular DNA chromosome, and ribosomes similar to those of\ncyanobacteria. As in mitochondria, each chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes. The outer membrane is thought to be\nderived from the enclosing vacuole of the host, and the inner membrane is thought to be derived from the plasma membrane of\nthe cyanobacterial endosymbiont. In the group of Archaeplastida called the glaucophytes and in the rhizarianPaulinella, a thin\npeptidoglycan layer is still present between the outer and inner plastid membranes. All other plastids lack this relict of the\n\n--- Page 598 ---\n578",

The chloroplasts of red and green algae, for instance, are derived from the engulfment of a photosynthetic\ncyanobacterium by an ancestral prokaryote.\nThis evidence suggests the possibility that an ancestral cell (already containing a photosynthetic endosymbiont) was engulfed by\nanother eukaryote cell, resulting in a secondary endosymbiosis. Molecular and morphological evidence suggest that the\nchlorarachniophyte protistsare derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event. Chlorarachniophytes are rare algae indigenous\nto tropical seas and sand. They are classified into the Rhizarian supergroup. Chlorarachniophytes are reticulose amoebae,\nextending thin cytoplasmic strands that interconnect them with other chlorarachniophytes in a cytoplasmic network. These\nprotists are thought to have originated when a eukaryote engulfed a green alga, the latter of which had previously established an\nendosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (Figure 23.6).\n\n--- Page 600 ---\n580",

Since\nmany protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often species-specific, there is a\nhuge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of their hosts. Because the name \"protist\" serves as a catchall term\nfor eukaryotic organisms that are not animal, plant, or fungi, it is not surprising that very few characteristics are common to all\nprotists. On the other hand, familiar characteristics of plants and animals are foreshadowed in various protists.\nCell Structure\nThe cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. Multicellular plants, animals, and fungi are embedded among the\nprotists in eukaryotic phylogeny. In most plants and animals and some fungi, complexity arises out ofmulticellularity,tissue\nspecialization,and subsequent interaction because of these features. Although a rudimentary form of multicellularity exists\namong some of the organisms labelled as \u201cprotists,\u201d those that have remained unicellular show how complexity can evolve in the\nabsence of true multicellularity, with the differentiation of cellular morphology and function.

Protist cells may be enveloped\nby animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound withpelliclesof\ninterlocking protein strips. The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced\nwithout compromising its range of motion.\nMetabolism\nProtists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic. Those that store energy by photosynthesis belong to a\ngroup ofphotoautotrophsand are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts. Other protists areheterotrophicand consume\norganic materials (such as other organisms) to obtain nutrition. Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest\nparticles by a process calledphagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off\nan intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole (Figure 23.7). In some protists, food vacuoles can be formed\nanywhere on the body surface, whereas in others, they may be restricted to the base of a specialized feeding structure. The\nvesicle containing the ingested particle, the phagosome, then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a\nphagolysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in\ncellular metabolism. Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell viaexocytosis.\nFigure23.7Phagocytosis. The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle, the digestion of the particle using\nhydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome, and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell.\nSubtypes of heterotrophs, called saprobes, absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes. Some protists can\nfunction asmixotrophs, obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes, depending on whether sunlight or\norganic nutrients are available.\nMotility\nThe majority of protists are motile, but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement (Figure 23.8). Some\nprotists have one or more flagella, which they rotate or whip. Others are covered in rows or tufts of tiny cilia that they beat in a\ncoordinated manner to swim. Still others form cytoplasmic extensions calledpseudopodiaanywhere on the cell, anchor the\npseudopodia to a substrate, and pull themselves forward. Some protists can move toward or away from a stimulus, a movement\nreferred to as taxis. For example, movement toward light, termed phototaxis, is accomplished by coupling their locomotion\nstrategy with a light-sensing organ.\n\n--- Page 602 ---\n582",

For instance, during times of stress, some slime molds develop into spore-generating fruiting bodies,\nmuch like fungi.\nThe slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types. Plasmodial slime molds are\ncomposed of large, multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of slime during their feeding stage\n(Figure 23.14). Food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it glides along. The \"dog vomit\" slime mold seen in\nFigure 23.14is a particularly colorful specimen and its ability to creep about might well trigger suspicion of alien invasion. Upon\nmaturation, the plasmodium takes on a net-like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies, or sporangia, during times\nof stress. Haploid spores are produced by meiosis within the sporangia, and spores can be disseminated through the air or\nwater to potentially land in more favorable environments. If this occurs, the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate\nhaploid cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle.\nFigure23.14Plasmodial slime molds.

The alveolates are named for the\npresence of an alveolus, or membrane-enclosed sac, beneath the cell membrane. The exact function of the alveolus is unknown,\nbut it may be involved in osmoregulation. The alveolates are further categorized into some of the better-known protists: the\ndinoflagellates, the apicomplexans, and the ciliates.\nDinoflagellates exhibit extensive morphological diversity and can be photosynthetic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic. The\nchloroplast of photosynthetic dinoflagellates was derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga. Many dinoflagellates are\nencased in interlocking plates of cellulose. Two perpendicular flagella fit into the grooves between the cellulose plates, with one\nflagellum extending longitudinally and a second encircling the dinoflagellate (Figure 23.21). Together, the flagella contribute to\nthe characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates. These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats, and are a\ncomponent ofplankton, the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for\nlarger aquatic organisms.\n\n--- Page 612 ---\n592",

By beating their cilia synchronously or in waves, ciliates can coordinate directed\nmovements and ingest food particles. Certain ciliates have fused cilia-based structures that function like paddles, funnels, or\nfins. Ciliates also are surrounded by a pellicle, providing protection without compromising agility. The genusParamecium\nincludes protists that have organized their cilia into a plate-like primitive mouth, called an oral groove, which is used to capture\nand digest bacteria (Figure 23.24). Food captured in the oral groove enters a food vacuole, where it combines with digestive\nenzymes. Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane, called the anal\npore. In addition to a vacuole-based digestive system,Parameciumalso usescontractile vacuoles, which are osmoregulatory\nvesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell.

This stramenopile cell has a single hairy flagellum and a secondary smooth flagellum.\nThe diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of\nsilicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles (Figure 23.27). These protists are a component of freshwater and marine\nplankton. Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually, although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also\nexist. Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell, called araphe.

Other cytoskeletal features include an axostyle, a bundle of fibers that runs the length of the\ncell and may even extend beyond it. Parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling, and these and other cytoskeletal\nmodifications may assist locomotion. Like the diplomonads, the parabasalids exhibit modified mitochondria. In parabasalids\nthese structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct.\nThe parabasalidTrichomonas vaginaliscauses trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease in humans, which appears in an\nestimated 180 million cases worldwide each year. Whereas men rarely exhibit symptoms during an infection with this protist,\ninfected women may become more susceptible to secondary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be\nmore likely to develop cervical cancer. Pregnant women infected withT. vaginalisare at an increased risk of serious\ncomplications, such as pre-term delivery.\nSome of the most complex of the parabasalids are those that colonize the rumen of ruminant animals and the guts of termites.\nThese organisms can digest cellulose, a metabolic talent that is unusual among eukaryotic cells.

Whereas some protist species are essential components of the food chain and\ngenerators of biomass, others function in the decomposition of organic materials. Still other protists are dangerous human\npathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases.\nPrimary Producers/Food Sources\nProtists are essential sources of food and provide nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as with zooplankton,\nprotists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms.\nParamecium bursariaand several other species of ciliates aremixotrophicdue to a symbiotic relationship with green algae. This\nis a temporary version of the secondarily endosymbiotic chloroplast found inEuglena. But these symbiotic associations are not\nrestricted to protists. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates calledzooxanthellaeprovide nutrients for the coral polyps\n(Figure 23.32) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete their calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals\nprovide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic\nrelationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a\nprocess calledcoral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reef-building corals typically do not reside in waters\ndeeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 621 ---",

This trypanosome confounds the human immune system by changing its thick layer of surface glycoproteins with each\ninfectious cycle. (The glycoproteins are identified by the immune system as foreign antigens, and a specific antibody defense is\nmounted against the parasite.) However,T.bruceihas thousands of possible antigens, and with each subsequent generation,\nthe protist switches to a glycoprotein coating with a different molecular structure. In this way,T.bruceiis capable of replicating\ncontinuously without the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite. Without treatment,T.bruceiattacks red\nblood cells, causing the patient to lapse into a coma and eventually die. During epidemic periods, mortality from the disease can\nbe high.

After about 10 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase but most never\ndevelop further symptoms. In about 30 percent of cases, however, the trypanosome causes further damage, especially to the\nheart and digestive system tissues in the chronic phase of infection, leading to malnutrition and heart failure due to abnormal\nheart rhythms.

Fungi are not\ncapable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources\nof energy and carbon. Fungi share a few other traits with animals. Their cell walls are composed of chitin,\nwhich is found in the exoskeletons of arthropods. Fungi produce a number of pigments, including\nmelanin,also found in the hair and skin of animals. Like animals, fungi also store carbohydrates as glycogen.\nHowever, like bacteria, fungi absorb nutrients across the cell surface and act as decomposers, helping to\nrecycle nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules.\nSome fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and\nsexual reproduction with alternation of generations. Most fungi produce a large number ofspores, which\nare haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals.\nFungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations. For example,\nmost terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi. The roots of the plant connect with the\nunderground parts of the fungus, which formmycorrhizae. Through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant\nexchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species. Alternatively, lichens are an\nassociation between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga).\nFungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. For example, Dutch elm disease, which is caused\nby the fungusOphiostoma ulmi, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many\nnative species of elm (Ulmussp.) by infecting the tree\u2019s vascular system. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector,\ntransmitting the disease from tree to tree. Accidentally introduced in the 1900s, the fungus decimated elm\ntrees across the continent. Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than\nAmerican elms.\nIn humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat. Unlike bacteria, fungi do not\nrespond to traditional antibiotic therapy, since they are eukaryotes. Fungal infections may prove deadly for\nindividuals with compromised immune systems.\nFungi have many commercial applications. The food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and cheese and\nwine making. Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation. Fungi are the source of\nmany commercial enzymes and antibiotics.\nAlthough humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times, until recently, the biology of\nfungi was poorly understood. In fact, up until the mid-20th century, many scientists classified fungi as\nplants! Fungi, like plants, are mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place. They possess a stem-like\nstructure similar to plants, as well as having a root-like fungal mycelium in the soil. In addition, their mode\nof nutrition was poorly understood.

Some medical microbiologists concentrate on the study of infectious diseases caused by fungi, called mycoses.\nMycologists collaborate with zoologists and plant pathologists to identify and control difficult fungal infections, such as the\ndevastating chestnut blight, the mysterious decline in frog populations in many areas of the world, or the deadly epidemic called\nwhite nose syndrome, which is decimating bats in the Eastern United States.\nGovernment agencies hire mycologists as research scientists and technicians to monitor the health of crops, national parks, and\nnational forests. Mycologists are also employed in the private sector by companies that develop chemical and biological control\nproducts or new agricultural products, and by companies that provide disease control services. Because of the key role played by\nfungi in the fermentation of alcohol and the preparation of many important foods, scientists with a good understanding of\nfungal physiology routinely work in the food technology industry. Oenology, the science of wine making, relies not only on the\nknowledge of grape varietals and soil composition, but also on a solid understanding of the characteristics of the wild yeasts\nthat thrive in different wine-making regions. It is possible to purchase yeast strains isolated from specific grape-growing\nregions. The great French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, made many of his essential discoveries working on the\nhumble brewer\u2019s yeast, thus discovering the process offermentation.\nCell Structure and Function\nFungi are eukaryotes, and as such, have a complex cellular organization. As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound\nnucleus. The DNA in the nucleus is wrapped around histone proteins, as is observed in other eukaryotic cells. A few types of\nfungi have accessory genomic structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of DNA); however, the horizontal transfer of\ngenetic information that occurs between one bacterium and another rarely occurs in fungi. Fungal cells also contain\nmitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.\nUnlike plant cells, fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll. Many fungi display bright colors arising from other\ncellular pigments, ranging from red to green to black. The poisonousAmanita muscaria(fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright\nred cap with white patches (Figure 24.2). Pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against\nultraviolet radiation. Some fungal pigments are toxic to humans.\nFigure24.2Amanita. The poisonousAmanita muscariais native to temperate and boreal regions of North America. (credit: Christine Majul)\nLike plant cells, fungal cells have a thick cell wall. The rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex polysaccharides called\nchitinandglucans. Chitin(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine), also found in the exoskeleton of arthropods such as insects, gives\nstructural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The wall protects the cell from desiccation and some predators. Fungi have plasma\nmembranes similar to those of other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized byergosterol: a steroid molecule that\nreplaces the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. However, flagella\nare produced by the spores and gametes in the primitive Phylum Chytridiomycota.\nGrowth\nThe vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellularthallus. Unicellular fungi are called yeasts. Multicellular fungi\nproduce threadlikehyphae(singular hypha). Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending\non environmental conditions.Saccharomyces cerevisiae(baker\u2019s yeast) andCandidaspecies (the agents of thrush, a common\n\n--- Page 632 ---\n612",

A bright field light micrograph of (c)Phialophora richardsiaeshows septa that divide the hyphae. (credit c:\nmodification of work by Dr. Lucille Georg, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic, and can grow with or without light. They vary in their oxygen\nrequirement. Most fungi areobligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. Other species, such as members of the\nChytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, areobligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because\noxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them. Yeasts are intermediate, beingfacultative anaerobes. This means that they\ngrow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration, but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not\navailable. The alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production.\nNutrition\nLike animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon, rather than fix carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants. In addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Like\nanimals, they must obtain it from their diet. However, unlike most animals, which ingest food and then digest it internally in\nspecialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order; digestion precedes ingestion. First,exoenzymesare\ntransported out of the hyphae, where they process nutrients in the environment. Then, the smaller molecules produced by this\nexternal digestionare absorbed through the large surface area of the mycelium. As with animal cells, the polysaccharide of\nstorage isglycogen, a branched polysaccaride, rather than amylopectin, a less densely branched polysaccharide, and amylose, a\nlinear polysaccharide, as found in plants.\nFungi are mostlysaprobes(saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.\nThey obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic material derived mainly from plants. Fungal exoenzymes are\nable to break down insoluble compounds, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose\nmolecules. The carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are thus released into the environment. Because of their varied metabolic\npathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools inbioremediationof chemically\ndamaged ecosystems. For example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs). Other species take up heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead.\nSome fungi are parasitic, infecting either plants or animals. Smut and Dutch elm disease affect plants, whereas athlete\u2019s foot\nand candidiasis (thrush) are medically important fungal infections in humans. In environments poor in nitrogen, some fungi\nresort to predation of nematodes (small non-segmented roundworms). In fact, species ofArthrobotrysfungi have a number of\nmechanisms to trap nematodes: One mechanism involves constricting rings within the network of hyphae. The rings swell when\nthey touch the nematode, gripping it in a tight hold. The fungus then penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized\nhyphae calledhaustoria.

The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late pre-\nCambrian period, more than 500million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of\nchytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; however, a few form multicellular organisms\nand hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). The Chytrids are the only fungi that have retained flagella. They\nproduce both gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. An unusual feature of the chytrids is\nthat both male and female gametes are flagellated.\nThe ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic\nenvironments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure\n24.11), while others are saprobes.

Filamentous ascomycetes produce hyphae divided by perforated\nsepta, allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to another. Conidia and asci, which are used respectively for asexual and\nsexual reproduction, are usually separated from the vegetative hyphae by blocked (non-perforated) septa. Many ascomycetes are\nof commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role for humanity, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine\nfermentation, and directly as food delicacies such as truffles and morels.Aspergillus oryzaeis used in the fermentation of rice to\nproduce sake. Other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals, including humans. For example, fungal pneumonia poses a\nsignificant threat to AIDS patients who have a compromised immune system. Ascomycetes not only infest and destroy crops\ndirectly; they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for consumption.\nAsexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploidconidiospores(Figure 24.14).\nSexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either one of two types of mating strains (Figure 24.14).\nThe \u201cmale\u201d strain produces an antheridium and the \u201cfemale\u201d strain develops an ascogonium. At fertilization, the antheridium\nand the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy, without nuclear fusion. Special dikaryotic ascogenous (ascus-producing) hyphae\narise from thisdikaryon, in which each cell has pairs of nuclei: one from the \u201cmale\u201d strain and one from the \u201cfemale\u201d strain. In\neach ascus, two haploid nuclei fuse in karyogamy. Thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called theascocarp. The diploid nucleus\nin each ascus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis, and spore walls form around each nucleus. The spores in each ascus contain\nthe meiotic products of a single diploid nucleus. The ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are\ndisseminated in the environment and start new mycelia (Figure 24.15).\n\n--- Page 640 ---\n620",

Special dikaryotic ascogenous (ascus-producing) hyphae\narise from thisdikaryon, in which each cell has pairs of nuclei: one from the \u201cmale\u201d strain and one from the \u201cfemale\u201d strain. In\neach ascus, two haploid nuclei fuse in karyogamy. Thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called theascocarp. The diploid nucleus\nin each ascus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis, and spore walls form around each nucleus. The spores in each ascus contain\nthe meiotic products of a single diploid nucleus. The ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are\ndisseminated in the environment and start new mycelia (Figure 24.15).\n\n--- Page 640 ---\n620"

The basidia, which are the reproductive\norgans of these fungi, are often contained within the familiar mushroom, commonly seen in fields after rain, on the\nsupermarket shelves, and growing on your lawn (Figure 24.16). These mushroom-producing basidiomycetes are sometimes\nreferred to as\u201cgill fungi\u201dbecause of the presence of gill-like structures on the underside of the cap. The gills are actually\ncompacted hyphaeon which the basidia are borne. This group also includes shelf fungi, which cling to the bark of trees like\nsmall shelves. In addition, the basidiomycota include smuts and rusts, which are important plant pathogens. Most edible fungi\nbelong to the Phylum Basidiomycota; however, some basidiomycota are inedible and produce deadly toxins. For example,\nCryptococcus neoformanscauses severe respiratory illness.

However,\nmost members of the Kingdom Fungi grow on the forest floor, where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris\nfrom plants and animals. In these environments, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers, making it possible for\nmembers of the other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and live.\nDecomposers and Recyclers\nThe food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter (Figure 24.19). Some elements\u2014such as\nnitrogen and phosphorus\u2014are required in large quantities by biological systems, and yet are not abundant in the environment.\nThe action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter, making them available to other living organisms. Trace\nelements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential for growth, and would remain tied up in rotting organic matter\nif fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolic activity.\nFigure24.19Bracket fungi. Fungi are an important part of ecosystem nutrient cycles. These bracket fungi growing on the side of a tree are\nthe fruiting structures of a basidiomycete. They receive their nutrients through their hyphae, which invade and decay the tree trunk. (credit:\nCory Zanker)\nThe ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition. As seen earlier, digestion\nprecedes ingestion. Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients. The enzymes are either released into the\nsubstrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall. Large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which\nare transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane. Because the movement of small\nmolecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of\nmoisture in the environment.\nAs saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat. In addition to\nreplenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, and sometimes\ndamaging, ways (Figure 24.20).\n\n--- Page 646 ---\n626",

In addition, individuals who\ndisplay hypersensitivity to molds and spores may develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. Fungal infections are\ngenerally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes.

One of these strategies is called tolerance. Many mosses, for example, can dry out to a brown and\nbrittle mat, but as soon as rain or a flood makes water available, mosses will absorb it and are restored to their healthy green\nappearance. Another strategy is to colonize environments with high humidity, where droughts are uncommon. Ferns, which are\nconsidered an early lineage of plants, thrive in damp and cool places such as the understory of temperate forests. Later, plants\nmoved away from moist or aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation, rather than tolerance. These plants, like cacti,\nminimize the loss of water to such an extent they can survive in extremely dry environments.\nThe most successful adaptation solution was the development of new structures that gave plants the advantage when colonizing\nnew and dry environments. Four major adaptations contribute to the success of terrestrial plants. The first adaptation is that the\nlife cycle in all land plants exhibits the alternation of generations, a sporophyte in which the spores are formed and a\ngametophyte that produces gametes. Second is an apical meristem tissue in roots and shoots. Third is the evolution of a waxy\ncuticle to resist desiccation (absent from some mosses). Finally cell walls with lignin to support structures off the ground. These\nadaptations all contribute to the success of the land plants, but are noticeably lacking in the closely related green algae\u2014another\nreason for the debate over their placement in the plant kingdom. They are also not all found in the mosses, which can be\nregarded as representing an intermediate stage in adaptation to land.\nAlternation of Generations\nAll sexually reproducing organisms have both haploid and diploid cells in their life cycles. In organisms withhaplonticlife\ncycles, the haploid stage is dominant, while in organisms with adiplonticlife cycle, the diploid stage is the dominant life stage.\nDominantin this context means both the stage in which the organism spends most of its time, and the stage in which most\nmitotic cell reproduction occurs\u2014the multicellular stage. In haplontic life cycles, the only diploid cell is the zygote, which\nundergoes immediate meiosis to restore the haploid state. In diplontic life cycles, the only haploid cells are the gametes, which\ncombine to restore the diploid state at their earliest convenience. Humans, for example, are diplontic.\nAlternation of generations describes a life cycle in which an organism has both haploid and diploid multicellular stages (Figure\n25.2). This type of life cycle, which is found in all plants, is described ashaplodiplontic.\nFigure25.2Alternation of generations between the 1ngametophyte and 2nsporophyte is shown. Mitosis occurs in both gametophyte and\nsporophyte generations. Diploid sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, while haploid gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis.\n(credit: Peter Coxhead)\nIn alternation of generations, the multicellular haploid form, known as a gametophyte, is followed in the developmental\nsequence by a multicellular diploid form, the sporophyte. The gametophyte gives rise to the gametes (reproductive cells) by\nmitosis. This can be the most obvious phase of the life cycle of the plant, as in the mosses, or it can occur in a microscopic\nstructure, such as a pollen grain, in the seed plants. The evolution of the land plants is marked by increasing prominence of the\nsporophyte generation. The sporophyte stage is barely noticeable in non-vascular plants (the collective term for the plants that\ninclude the liverworts and mosses). In the seed plants, the sporophyte phase can be a towering tree, as in sequoias and pines.\nProtection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants.

Subsequent enlargement of these\ncells causes the organ to grow and elongate. The root cap protects the fragile apical meristem as the root tip is pushed through the soil by\ncell elongation.\nAdditional Land Plant Adaptations\nAs plants adapted to dry land and became independent from the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and\nstructures made their appearance. Early land plants did not grow more than a few inches off the ground, competing for light on\nthese low mats. By developing a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light. Because air offers substantially\nless support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks). In small plants\nsuch as single-celled algae, simple diffusion suffices to distribute water and nutrients throughout the organism. However, for\nplants to evolve larger forms, the evolution of a conductive tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a prerequisite.\nThe evolution of vascular tissue in plants met both of these needs. The vascular system contains two types of conductive tissue:\nxylem and phloem. Xylem conducts water and minerals absorbed from the soil up to the shoot, while phloem transports food\nderived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant. In xylem, the cells walls are reinforced with lignin, whose tough\nhydrophobic polymers help prevent the seepage of water across the xylem cell walls. Lignin also adds to the strength of these\ntissues in supporting the plant. The vascular tissues extend into the root of land plants. The root system evolved to take up water\nand minerals from the soil, and to anchor the increasingly taller shoot in the soil.\nIn land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle protects the leaves and stems from desiccation. However, the cuticle also\nprevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. To overcome this, stomata\nor pores that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor appeared in plants as they moved away from moist\nenvironments into drier habitats.\nWater filters ultraviolet-B (UVB) light, which is harmful to all organisms, especially those that must absorb light to survive. This\nfiltering does not occur for land plants. Exposure to damaging radiation presented an additional challenge to land colonization,\nwhich was met by the evolution of biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of protective flavonoids and other pigments that\nabsorb UV wavelengths of light and protect the aerial parts of plants from photodynamic damage.\nPlants cannot avoid being eaten by animals. Instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex\norganic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals. These toxic compounds can also\ncause severe diseases and even death, thus discouraging predation. Humans have used many of these compounds for centuries\nas drugs, medications, or spices. In contrast, as plants co-evolved with animals, the development of sweet and nutritious\nmetabolites lured animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds. Plants have been\nenlisting animals to be their helpers in this way for hundreds of millions of years.\nEvolution of Land Plants\nNo discussion of the evolution of plants on land can be undertaken without a brief review of the timeline of the geological eras.\nThe early era, known as the Paleozoic, is divided into six periods. It starts with the Cambrian period, followed by the Ordovician,\nSilurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. The major event to mark the Ordovician, more than 500 million years ago, was\nthe colonization of land by the ancestors of modern land plants.

The brown and golden algae,\nhowever, are now reassigned to the protist supergroup Chromalveolata. This is because apart from their ability to capture light\nenergy and fix CO2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that are characteristic of plants. The plants are now\nclassified, along with the red and green algae, in the protist supergroup Archaeplastida. Green algae contain the same\ncarotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of\nchlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch. Their\ncells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants. Which\nof the green algae to include among the plants has not been phylogenetically resolved.\nGreen algae fall into two major groups, the chlorophytes and the charophytes. The chlorophytes include the generaChlorella,\nChlamydomonas, the \u201csea lettuce\u201dUlva, and the colonial algaVolvox. The charophytes include desmids, as well as the genera\nSpirogyra,Coleochaete, andChara. There are familiar green algae in both groups. Some green algae are single cells, such as\nChlamydomonasand desmids, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular. Other\ngreen algae, likeVolvox, form colonies, and some, likeUlvaare multicellular (Figure 25.7).Spirogyrais a long filament of colonial\ncells. Most members of this genus live in fresh water, brackish water, seawater, or even in snow patches.

First, cells in charophytes and the land plants divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, in\nwhich microtubules parallel to the spindle serve as guides for the vesicles of the forming cell plate. In the chlorophytes, the cell\nplate is organized by a phycoplast, in which the microtubules are perpendicular to the spindle. Second, only the charophytes and\nthe land plants have plasmodesmata, or intercellular channels that allow the transfer of materials from cell to cell. In the\nchlorophytes, intercellular connections do not persist in mature multicellular forms. Finally, both charophytes and the land\nplants showapical growth\u2014growth from the tips of the plant rather than throughout the plant body. Consequently, land plants\nand the charophytes are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta.\nReproduction of Green Algae\nGreen algae reproduce both asexually, by fragmentation or dispersal of spores, or sexually, by producing gametes that fuse\nduring fertilization. In a single-celled organism such asChlamydomonas, there is no mitosis after fertilization. In the\nmulticellularUlva, a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization (and thus exhibits alternation of generations). Both\nChlamydomonasandUlvaproduce flagellated gametes.\nCharophytes\nThe charophytes include several different algal orders that have each been suggested to be the closest relatives of the land plants:\nthe Charales, the Zygnematales, and the Coleochaetales. The Charales can be traced back 420 million years. They live in a range\nof freshwater habitats and vary in size from a few millimeters to a meter in length.

The first bryophytes (liverworts) most likely appeared in the\nOrdovician period, about 450 million years ago. Because they lack lignin and other resistant structures, the likelihood of\nbryophytes forming fossils is rather small. Some spores protected bysporopolleninhave survived and are attributed to early\nbryophytes. By the Silurian period (435 MYA), however, vascular plants had spread through the continents. This compelling fact\nis used as evidence that non-vascular plants must have preceded the Silurian period.\nMore than 25,000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats, although some live in deserts. They constitute the major\nflora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages.\nThey generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids (xylem cells specialized for water conduction). Rather, water and\nnutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells.

More than 260,000 species\nof tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth\u2019s vegetation. Several evolutionary innovations explain their success\nand their ability to spread to all habitats.\nBryophytes may have been successful at the transition from an aquatic habitat to land, but they are still dependent on water for\nreproduction, and must absorb moisture and nutrients through the gametophyte surface. The lack of roots for absorbing water\nand minerals from the soil, as well as a lack of lignin-reinforced conducting cells, limit bryophytes to small sizes. Although they\nmay survive in reasonably dry conditions, they cannot reproduce and expand their habitat range in the absence of water.\nVascular plants, on the other hand, can achieve enormous heights, thus competing successfully for light. Photosynthetic organs\nbecome leaves, and pipe-like cells or vascular tissues transport water, minerals, and fixed carbon organic compounds\nthroughout the organism.\nThroughout plant evolution, there is a progressive increase in the dominance of the sporophyte generation. In seedless vascular\nplants, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle. The gametophyte is now less conspicuous, but still\nindependent of the sporophyte. Seedless vascular plants still depend on water during fertilization, as the flagellated sperm must\nswim on a layer of moisture to reach the egg. This step in reproduction explains why ferns and their relatives are more abundant\nin damp environments.\nVascular Tissue: Xylem and Phloem\nThe first plant fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue date to the Silurian period, about 430million years ago.

The tissue consists of conducting cells, known as tracheids, and\nsupportive filler tissue, called parenchyma. Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compoundlignininto their walls, and are\nthus described as lignified. Lignin itself is a complex polymer: It is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength on\nvascular tissue. With their rigid cell walls, the xylem cells provide support to the plant and allow it to achieve impressive heights.\nTall plants have a selective advantage by being able to reach unfiltered sunlight and disperse their spores or seeds away from the\nparent plant, thus expanding the species\u2019 range. By growing higher than other plants, tall trees cast their shadows on shorter\nplants and thereby outcompete them for water and precious nutrients in the soil.\nPhloemis the second type of vascular tissue; it transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes throughout the plant. Phloem cells\nare divided into sieve elements (conducting cells) and cells that support thesieve elements. Together, xylem and phloem tissues\nform the vascular system of plants (Figure 25.16).\nFigure25.16Vascular bundles in celery. This cross section of a celery stalk shows a number of vascular bundles. The xylem is on the inner\npart of each bundle. (credit: fir0002 | flagstaffotos.com.au [GFDL 1.2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/fdl-1.2.html)], via\nWikimedia Commons. Image modified from source.)\nRoots: Support for the Plant\nRoots are not well-preserved in the fossil record. Nevertheless, it seems that roots appeared later in evolution than vascular\ntissue. The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants. Thin rhizoids\nattached bryophytes to the substrate, but these rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; nor did\nthey absorb substantial amounts of water and nutrients. In contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system,\ntransfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant. The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep into the\nsoil to reach sources of water also stabilizes plants by acting as a ballast or anchor. The majority of roots establish a symbiotic\nrelationship with fungi, forming mutualistic mycorrhizae, which benefit the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for\nabsorption of water, soil minerals, and nutrients.\nLeaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili\nA third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants. Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of\nvascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency. Leaves capture more sunlight with their\nincreased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy, which is then used\nto fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive\ncells of phloem tissue.\n\n--- Page 678 ---\n658",

They are also\nconsidered to be the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants.\nMore than 20,000 species of ferns live in environments ranging from the tropics to temperate forests. Although some species\nsurvive in dry environments, most ferns are restricted to moist, shaded places. Ferns made their appearance in the fossil record\nduring the Devonian period (420 MYA) and expanded during the Carboniferous (360 to 300 MYA).\nThe dominant stage of the life cycle of a fern is the sporophyte, which consists of large compound leaves called fronds. Fronds\nmay be either finely divided or broadly lobed. Fronds fulfill a double role; they are photosynthetic organs that also carry\nreproductive organs. The stem may be buried underground as a rhizome, from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water\nand nutrients from the soil; or, they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns (Figure 25.21).Adventitiousorgans are those\nthat grow in unusual places, such as roots growing from the side of a stem.\nFigure25.21A tree fern.

(credit a: modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit b:\nmodification of work by Myriam Feldman)\nOn the underside of each mature fern frond are groups of sporangia called sori (Figure 25.23a). Most ferns are homosporous.\nSpores are produced by meiosis and are released into the air from the sporangium. Those that land on a suitable substrate\ngerminate and form a heart-shaped gametophyte, or prothallus, which is attached to the ground by thin filamentous rhizoids\n(Figure 25.23b). Gametophytes produce both antheridia and archegonia. Like the sperm cells of other pterophytes, fern sperm\nhave multiple flagella and must swim to the archegonium, which releases a chemoattractant to guide them. The zygote develops\ninto a fern sporophyte, which emerges from the archegonium of the gametophyte. Maturation of antheridia and archegonia at\ndifferent times encourages cross-fertilization. The full life cycle of a fern is depicted inFigure 25.24.\n\n--- Page 682 ---\n662",

A prime example of early American\nclassical design is Monticello, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s private estate. Among his many interests, Jefferson maintained a strong\npassion for botany.

The restoration of natural places encroached on by human\nintervention, such as wetlands, also requires the expertise of a landscape designer.\nWith such an array of necessary skills, a landscape designer\u2019s education should include a solid background in botany, soil\nscience, plant pathology, entomology, and horticulture.

The pollen is\nmagnified 1,054 times. (credit: R.G. Baker, USGS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nEvolution of Angiosperms\nThe roughly 200 million years between the appearance of the gymnosperms and the flowering plants gives us some appreciation\nfor the evolutionary experimentation that ultimately produced flowers and fruit. Angiosperms (\u201cseed in a vessel\u201d) produce a\nflower containing male and/or female reproductive structures. Fossil evidence (Figure 26.6) indicates that flowering plants first\nappeared about 125 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous (late in the Mesozoic era), and were rapidly diversifying by about\n100 million years ago in the Middle Cretaceous. Earlier traces of angiosperms are scarce. Fossilized pollen recovered from\nJurassic geological material has been attributed to angiosperms. A few early Cretaceous rocks show clear imprints of leaves\nresembling angiosperm leaves. By the mid-Cretaceous, a staggering number of diverse flowering plants crowd the fossil record.\nThe same geological period is also marked by the appearance of many modern groups of insects, suggesting that pollinating\ninsects played a key role in the evolution of flowering plants.\nNew data in comparative genomics and paleobotany (the study of ancient plants) have shed some light on the evolution of\nangiosperms. Although the angiosperms appeared after the gymnosperms, they are probably not derived from gymnosperm\nancestors. Instead, the angiosperms form a sister clade (a species and its descendents) that developed in parallel with the\ngymnosperms. The two innovative structures of flowers and fruit represent an improved reproductive strategy that served to\nprotect the embryo, while increasing genetic variability and range. There is no current consensus on the origin of the\nangiosperms. Paleobotanists debate whether angiosperms evolved from small woody bushes, or were related to the ancestors of\ntropical grasses. Both views draw support from cladistics, and the so-called woodymagnoliid hypothesis\u2014which proposes that\nthe early ancestors of angiosperms were shrubs like modern magnolia\u2014also offers molecular biological evidence.\nThe most primitive living angiosperm is considered to beAmborella trichopoda, a small plant native to the rainforest of New\nCaledonia, an island in the South Pacific. Analysis of the genome ofA. trichopodahas shown that it is related to all existing\nflowering plants and belongs to the oldest confirmed branch of the angiosperm family tree. The nuclear genome shows evidence\nof an ancient whole-genome duplication. The mitochondrial genome is large and multichromosomal, containing elements from\nthe mitochondrial genomes of several other species, including algae and a moss. A few other angiosperm groups, called basal\nangiosperms, are viewed as having ancestral traits because they branched off early from the phylogenetic tree. Most modern\nangiosperms are classified as either monocots or eudicots, based on the structure of their leaves and embryos. Basal\n\n--- Page 694 ---\n674",

The genes encoding the 18S ribosomal RNA from the small subunit and plastid genes are\nfrequently chosen for DNA alignment analysis.\nOnce the sequences of interest are obtained, they are compared with existing sequences in databases such as GenBank, which is\nmaintained by The National Center for Biotechnology Information. A number of computational tools are available to align and\nanalyze sequences. Sophisticated computer analysis programs determine the percentage of sequence identity or homology.\nSequence homology can be used to estimate the evolutionary distance between two DNA sequences and reflect the time elapsed\nsince the genes separated from a common ancestor. Molecular analysis has revolutionized phylogenetic trees. In some cases,\nprior results from morphological studies have been confirmed: for"

The function of the flower is to\nensure pollination, often by arthropods, as well as to protect a developing embryo. The colors and patterns on flowers offer\nspecific signals to many pollinating insects or birds and bats that have coevolved with them. For example, some patterns are\nvisible only in the ultraviolet range of light, which can be seen by arthropod pollinators. For some pollinators, flowers advertise\nthemselves as a reliable source of nectar. Flower scent also helps to select its pollinators. Sweet scents tend to attract bees and\nbutterflies and moths, but some flies and beetles might prefer scents that signal fermentation or putrefaction. Flowers also\nprovide protection for the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle. The function of the fruit is seed protection and\ndispersal. Different fruit structures or tissues on fruit\u2014such as sweet flesh, wings, parachutes, or spines that grab\u2014reflect the\ndispersal strategies that help spread seeds.\nFlowers\nFlowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central receptacle. Although they vary greatly in appearance,\nvirtually all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle typically attaches the flower\nto the plant proper. A whorl ofsepals(collectively called thecalyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the\nunopened floral bud. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in\nlilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical.Petals, collectively thecorolla, are located\ninside the whorl of sepals and may display vivid colors to attract pollinators.

Other fruits, such as the\npineapple, form from clusters of flowers. Additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds. Regardless of how\nthey are formed, fruits are an agent of seed dispersal. The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal.\nWind carries the light dry fruits of trees and dandelions. Water transports floating coconuts. Some fruits attract herbivores with\ntheir color or scent, or as food. Once eaten, tough, undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivore\u2019s feces (endozoochory).\nOther fruits have burrs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals (epizoochory).\nDiversity of Angiosperms\nAngiosperms are classified in a single phylum: theAnthophyta. Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which\nas you may recall means that they originated from a single ancestor. Within the angiosperms are three major groups: basal\nangiosperms, monocots, and dicots. Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the\nseparation of the monocots and eudicots, because they exhibit traits from both groups. They are categorized separately in most\nclassification schemes. The basal angiosperms includeAmborella, water lilies, the Magnoliids (magnolia trees, laurels, and spice\npeppers), and a group called the Austrobaileyales, which includes the star anise. The monocots and dicots are differentiated on\nthe basis of the structure of the cotyledons, pollen grains, and other structures. Monocots include grasses and lilies, and the\ndicots form a multi-branched group that includes (among many others) roses, cabbages, sunflowers, and mints.\nBasal Angiosperms\nThe Magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias, laurels, and peppers. Magnolias are tall trees bearing dark, shiny leaves, and\nlarge, fragrant flowers with many parts, and are considered archaic (Figure 26.17). In the outer whorl of the magnolia flower the\nsepals and petals are undifferentiated and are collectively called tepals. The reproductive parts are arranged in a spiral around a\ncone-shaped receptacle, with the carpels located above the stamens (Figure 26.17). The aggregate fruit, with one seed formed\nfrom each carpel, is seen inFigure 26.18d. Laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. TheLaurales\ngrow mostly in warmer climates and are small trees and shrubs. Familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel, cinnamon,\nspice bush (Figure 26.18a), and avocado tree.\nFigure26.17Magnolia grandiflora. A cluster of carpels can be seen above the stamens, which have shed their pollen and begun to drop\nfrom the inflorescence. In the flower, the sepals and petals are undifferentiated and are collectively called tepals.

Plants play a key role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems\nthrough the stabilization of soils, cycling of carbon, and climate moderation. Large tropical forests release oxygen and act as\ncarbon dioxide \u201csinks.\u201d Seed plants provide shelter to many life forms, as well as food for herbivores, thereby indirectly feeding\ncarnivores. Plant secondary metabolites are used for medicinal purposes and industrial production. Virtually all animal life is\ndependent on plants for survival.\nAnimals and Plants: Herbivory\nCoevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support, especially because\nboth angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic. Many authors have attributed the\ndiversity of plants and insects to both pollination andherbivory, or the consumption of plants by insects and other animals.\nHerbivory is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination. Coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is easily\nand commonly observed in nature. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry\nanimals (although mimicry has been used to entice pollinators). A sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores. To\n\u201ccombat\u201d herbivores, some plant seeds\u2014such as acorn and unripened persimmon\u2014are high in alkaloids and therefore unsavory\nto some animals. Other plants are protected by bark, although some animals developed specialized mouth pieces to tear and\nchew vegetal material. Spines and thorns (Figure 26.20) deter most animals, except for mammals with thick fur, and some birds\nhave specialized beaks to get past such defenses.\nFigure26.20Plant defenses. (a) Spines and (b) thorns are examples of plant defenses. (credit a: modification of work by Jon Sullivan;\ncredit b: modification of work by I. S\u00e1\u010dek, Sr.)\nHerbivory has been exploited by seed plants for their own benefit. The dispersal of fruits by herbivorous animals is a striking\nexample of mutualistic relationships. The plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in return for spreading the\nplant\u2019s genetic material to a wider area.\nAn extreme example of coevolution (discovered by Daniel Janzen) between an animal and a plant is exemplified by Mexican\nacacia trees and their attendant acacia antsPseudomyrmexspp. (this is termedmyrmecophytism). The trees support the ants\nwith shelter and food: The ants nest in the hollows of large thorns produced by the tree and feed on sugary secretions produced\nat the ends of the leaves. The sugar pellets also help to keep the ants from interfering with insect pollinators. In return, ants\ndiscourage herbivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates, by stinging and attacking leaf-eaters and insects ovipositing on the\nplants. The ants also help to remove potential plant pathogens, such as fungal growths. Another case of insect-plant coevolution\nis found in bracken fern (Pteridium aquinilum), whose subspecies are found throughout the world. Bracken ferns produce a\nnumber of \u201csecondary plant compounds\u201d in their adult fronds that serve as defensive compounds against nonadapted insect\nattack (these compounds include cyanogenic glucosides, tannins, and phenolics). However, during the \u201cfiddlehead\u201d or crozier\nstage, bracken secretes nutritious sugary and proteinaceous compounds from special \u201cnectaries\u201d that attract ants and even\nspecies of jumping spiders, all of which defend the plant\u2019s croziers until they are fully unfolded.

Consequently, plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators. With over 200,000 different plants\ndependent on animal pollination, the plant needs to advertise to its pollinators with some specificity. The specificity of\nspecialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising. It is possible, for example, to determine the general type\nof pollinators favored by a plant by observing the flower\u2019s physical characteristics. Many bird or insect-pollinated flowers secrete\nnectar, which is a sugary liquid. They also produce both fertile pollen, for reproduction, and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for\nbirds and insects. Many butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light, and flowers that attract these pollinators usually display\na pattern of ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flower's center. In this manner, pollinating insects collect\nnectar while at the same time are dusted with pollen (Figure 26.21). Large, red flowers with little smell and a long funnel shape\nare preferred by hummingbirds, who have good color perception, a poor sense of smell, and need a strong perch.

This differentiation and\nspecialization of tissues is part of what allows for such incredible animal diversity.\nJust as there are multiple ways to be a eukaryote, there are multiple ways to be a multicellular animal. The animal kingdom is\ncurrently divided into five monophyletic clades: Parazoa or Porifera (sponges), Placozoa (tiny parasitic creatures that resemble\nmulticellular amoebae), Cnidaria (jellyfish and their relatives), Ctenophora (the comb jellies), and Bilateria (all other animals).\nThe Placozoa (\"flat animal\") and Parazoa (\u201cbeside animal\u201d) do not have specialized tissues derived from germ layers of the\nembryo; although they do possess specialized cells that actfunctionallylike tissues. The Placozoa have only four cell types, while\nthe sponges have nearly two dozen. The three other clades do include animals with specialized tissues derived from the germ\nlayers of the embryo. In spite of their superficial similarity to Cnidarian medusae, recent molecular studies indicate that the\nCtenophores are only distantly related to the Cnidarians, which together with the Bilateria constitute the Eumetazoa (\"true\nanimals\"). When we think of animals, we usually think of Eumetazoa, since most animals fall into this category.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch apresentation(http://openstax.org/l/saving_life)by biologist E.O. Wilson on the importance of diversity.\nAnimal Reproduction and Development\nMost animals are diploid organisms, meaning that their body (somatic) cells are diploid and haploid reproductive (gamete) cells\nare produced through meiosis. Some exceptions exist: for example, in bees, wasps, and ants, the male is haploid because it\ndevelops from unfertilized eggs. Most animals undergo sexual reproduction. However, a few groups, such as cnidarians,\nflatworms, and roundworms, may also undergo asexual reproduction, in which offspring originate from part of the parental\nbody.\nProcesses of Animal Reproduction and Embryonic Development\nDuring sexual reproduction, the haploid gametes of the male and female individuals of a species combine in a process called\nfertilization. Typically, both male and female gametes are required: the small, motile male sperm fertilizes the typically much\nlarger, sessile female egg. This process produces a diploid fertilized egg called a zygote.\nSome animal species\u2014including sea stars and sea anemones\u2014are capable of asexual reproduction. The most common forms of\nasexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals includebuddingandfragmentation, where part of a parent individual can\nseparate and grow into a new individual. This type of asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring, which\nwould appear to be disadvantageous from the perspective of evolutionary adaptability, simply because of the potential buildup\nof deleterious mutations.\nIn contrast, a form of uniparental reproduction found in some insects and a few vertebrates is called parthenogenesis (or \u201cvirgin\nbeginning\u201d). In this case, progeny develop from a gamete, but without fertilization. Because of the nutrients stored in eggs, only\nfemales produce parthenogenetic offspring. In some insects, unfertilized eggs develop into new male offspring. This type of sex\ndetermination is called haplodiploidy, since females are diploid (with both maternal and paternal chromosomes) and males are\nhaploid (with only maternal chromosomes). A few vertebrates, e.g., some fish, turkeys, rattlesnakes, and whiptail lizards, are\nalso capable of parthenogenesis. In the case of turkeys and rattlesnakes, parthenogenetically reproducing females also produce\nonly male offspring, but not because the males are haploid. In birds and rattlesnakes, the female is the heterogametic (ZW) sex,\nso the only surviving progeny of post-meiotic parthenogenesis would be ZZ males. In the whiptail lizards, on the other hand,\nonly female progeny are produced by parthenogenesis. These animals may not be identical to their parent, although they have\nonly maternal chromosomes. However, for animals that are limited in their access to mates, uniparental reproduction can\nensure genetic propagation.\nIn animals, the zygote progresses through a series of developmental stages, during which primarygerm layers(ectoderm,\nendoderm, and mesoderm) are established and reorganize to form an embryo. During this process, animal tissues begin to\nspecialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology.\nAnimal development begins withcleavage, a series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote (Figure 27.3). Cleavage differs from\nsomatic cell division in that the egg is subdivided by successive cleavages into smaller and smaller cells, withnoactual cell\ngrowth. The cells resulting from subdivision of the material of the egg in this way are calledblastomeres. Three cell divisions\ntransform the single-celled zygote into an eight-celled structure.

Surprisingly, a human embryo and a frog embryo, at a certain stage of\nembryonic development, look remarkably alike! For a long time, scientists did not understand why so many animal species\nlooked similar during embryonic development but were very different as adults. They wondered what dictated the\ndevelopmental direction that a fly, mouse, frog, or human embryo would take. Near the end of the twentieth century, a\nparticular class of genes was discovered that had this very job. These genes that determine animal structure are called \u201chomeotic\ngenes,\u201d and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes. Genes with homeoboxes encode protein transcription factors. One\ngroup of animal genes containing homeobox sequences is specifically referred to asHoxgenes. This cluster of genes is\nresponsible for determining the general body plan, such as the number of body segments of an animal, the number and\nplacement of appendages, and animal head-tail directionality. The firstHoxgenes to be sequenced were those from the fruit fly\n(Drosophila melanogaster). A singleHoxmutation in the fruit fly can result in an extra pair of wings or even legs growing from\nthe head in place of antennae (this is because antennae and legs are embryologic homologous structures and their appearance as\nantennae or legs is dictated by their origination within specific body segments of the head and thorax during development).\nNow,Hoxgenes are known from virtually all other animals as well.\nWhile there are a great many genes that play roles in the morphological development of an animal, including other homeobox-\ncontaining genes, what makesHoxgenes so powerful is that they serve as \u201cmaster control genes\u201d that can turn on or off large\nnumbers of other genes.Hoxgenes do this by encoding transcription factors that control the expression of numerous other\ngenes.Hoxgenes are homologous across the animal kingdom, that is, the genetic sequences ofHoxgenes and their positions on\n\n--- Page 724 ---\n704",

Recall that these germ\nlayers are formed duringgastrulation, and that each germ layer typically gives rise to specific types of embryonic tissues and\norgans. Animals develop either two or three embryonic germ layers (Figure 27.9). The animals that display radial, biradial, or\nrotational symmetry develop two germ layers, an inner layer (endodermormesendoderm) and an outer layer (ectoderm). These\nanimals are calleddiploblasts, and have a nonliving middle layer between the endoderm and ectoderm (although individual cells\nmay be distributed through this middle layer, there is nocoherentthird layer of tissue). The four clades considered to be\ndiploblastic have different levels of complexity and different developmental pathways, although there is little information about\ndevelopment in Placozoa.

The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) is an example of a\npseudocoelomate. True coelomates can be further characterized based on other features of their early embryological\ndevelopment.\nFigure27.10Body cavities. Triploblasts may be (a) acoelomates, (b) eucoelomates, or (c) pseudocoelomates. Acoelomates have no body\ncavity. Eucoelomates have a body cavity within the mesoderm, called a coelom, in which both the gut and the body wall are lined with\nmesoderm. Pseudocoelomates also have a body cavity, but only the body wall is lined with mesoderm. (credit a: modification of work by\nJan Derk; credit b: modification of work by NOAA; credit c: modification of work by USDA, ARS)\nEmbryonic Development of the Mouth\nBilaterally symmetrical, tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in the origin of\nthe mouth. When the primitive gut forms, the opening that first connects the gut cavity to the outside of the embryo is called\nthe blastopore. Most animals have openings at both ends of the gut: mouth at one end and anus at the other. One of these\nopenings will develop at or near the site of theblastopore. InProtostomes(\"mouth first\"), the mouth develops at the blastopore\n(Figure 27.11). InDeuterostomes(\"mouth second\"), the mouth develops at the other end of the gut (Figure 27.11) and the anus\ndevelops at the site of the blastopore. Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids. Deuterostomes include more\ncomplex animals such as chordates but also some \u201csimple\u201d animals such as echinoderms. Recent evidence has challenged this\nsimple view of the relationship between the location of the blastopore and the formation of the mouth, however, and the theory\nremains under debate. Nevertheless, these details of mouth and anus formation reflectgeneraldifferences in the organization\nof protostome and deuterostome embryos, which are also expressed in other developmental features.\nOne of these differences between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation, beginning from the\ngastrula stage. Since body cavity formation tends to accompany the formation of the mesoderm, the mesoderm of protostomes\nand deuterostomes forms differently. The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process calledschizocoely.

Triploblasts may be (a) acoelomates, (b) eucoelomates, or (c) pseudocoelomates. Acoelomates have no body\ncavity. Eucoelomates have a body cavity within the mesoderm, called a coelom, in which both the gut and the body wall are lined with\nmesoderm. Pseudocoelomates also have a body cavity, but only the body wall is lined with mesoderm. (credit a: modification of work by\nJan Derk; credit b: modification of work by NOAA; credit c: modification of work by USDA, ARS)\nEmbryonic Development of the Mouth\nBilaterally symmetrical, tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in the origin of\nthe mouth. When the primitive gut forms, the opening that first connects the gut cavity to the outside of the embryo is called\nthe blastopore. Most animals have openings at both ends of the gut: mouth at one end and anus at the other. One of these\nopenings will develop at or near the site of theblastopore. InProtostomes(\"mouth first\"), the mouth develops at the blastopore\n(Figure 27.11). InDeuterostomes(\"mouth second\"), the mouth develops at the other end of the gut (Figure 27.11) and the anus\ndevelops at the site of the blastopore. Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids. Deuterostomes include more\ncomplex animals such as chordates but also some \u201csimple\u201d animals such as echinoderms. Recent evidence has challenged this\nsimple view of the relationship between the location of the blastopore and the formation of the mouth, however, and the theory\nremains under debate. Nevertheless, these details of mouth and anus formation reflectgeneraldifferences in the organization\nof protostome and deuterostome embryos, which are also expressed in other developmental features.\nOne of these differences between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation, beginning from the\ngastrula stage. Since body cavity formation tends to accompany the formation of the mesoderm, the mesoderm of protostomes\nand deuterostomes forms differently. The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process calledschizocoely. The\nmesoderm in these organisms is usually the product of specificblastomeres, which migrate into the interior of the embryo and\nform two clumps of mesodermal tissue. Within each clump, cavities develop and merge to form the hollow opening of the\ncoelom. Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process calledenterocoely.

Flatworms rely on passive diffusion for nutrient\ntransport across their body.\nInpseudocoelomates, there is a body cavity between the gut and the body wall, but only the body wall has mesodermal tissue. In\nthese animals, the mesoderm forms, but does not develop cavities within it. Major pseudocoelomate phyla are the rotifers and\nnematodes. Animals that have a true coelom are calledeucoelomates; all vertebrates, as well as molluscs, annelids, arthropods,\nand echinoderms, are eucoelomates. The coelom develops within the mesoderm during embryogenesis. Of the major bilaterian\nphyla, the molluscs, annelids, and arthropods areschizocoels, in which the mesoderm splits to form the body cavity, while the\nechinoderms and chordates areenterocoels, in which the mesoderm forms as two or more buds off of the gut. These buds\nseparate from the gut and coalesce to form the body cavity. In the vertebrates, mammals have a subdivided body cavity, with the\nthoracic cavity separated from the abdominal cavity.

The study ofphylogeny(the branching sequence of evolution) aims to determine the evolutionary relationships\nbetween phyla. Currently, most biologists divide the animal kingdom into 35 to 40 phyla. Scientists develop phylogenetic trees,\nwhich serve ashypothesesabout which species have evolved from which ancestors.\nRecall that until recently, only morphological characteristics and the fossil record were used to determine phylogenetic\nrelationships among animals. Scientific understanding of the distinctions and hierarchies between anatomical characteristics\nprovided much of this knowledge. Used alone, however, this information can be misleading. Morphological characteristics (such\nas skin color, body shape, etc.) may evolve multiple times, and independently, through evolutionary history. Analogous\ncharacteristics may appear similar between animals, but their underlying evolution may be very different. With the\nadvancement ofmolecular technologies, modern phylogenetics is now informed by genetic and molecular analyses, in addition\nto traditional morphological and fossil data. With a growing understanding of genetics, the animal evolutionary tree has\nchanged substantially and continues to change as new DNA and RNA analyses are performed on additional animal species.\nConstructing an Animal Phylogenetic Tree\nThe current understanding of evolutionary relationships among animal, orMetazoa, phyla begins with the distinction between\nanimals withtrue differentiated tissues, calledEumetazoa, and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues, such\nas the sponges (Porifera) and the Placozoa. Similarities between the feeding cells of sponges (choanocytes) and choanoflagellate\nprotists (Figure 27.12) have been used to suggest that Metazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembled the\nmoderncolonial choanoflagellates.\nFigure27.12Choanoflagellates and choanocytes. Cells of the protist choanoflagellate clade closely resemble sponge choanocyte cells.\n\n--- Page 732 ---\n712",

Due to morphological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were\nonce thought to be closely related. However, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to\nnematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other\nphyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. These two clades now make up the protostomes.\nAnother change to former phylogenetic groupings because of modern molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely\nnew phylum of worm called Acoelomorpha. These acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes\nbecause of their similar \u201cflatworm\u201d morphology. However, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and\noriginally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. More recent research\ninto the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested that the acoels are more closely related to\ndeuterostomes. The placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data,\ntheir true phylogeny will be determined.\nAnother example of phylogenetic reorganization involves the identification of the Ctenophora as the basal clade of the animal\nkingdom. Ctenophora, or comb jellies, were once considered to be a sister group of the Cnidaria, and the sponges (Porifera)\nwere placed as the basal animal group, sister to other animals.

On the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in\ndevastating losses of diversity to some clades, yet provide new opportunities for others to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d and speciate. Such\nperiods ofmass extinction(Figure 27.19) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines\nwhile creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind. The end of the Permian period (and the Paleozoic Era)\nwas marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth\u2019s history, a loss of an estimated 95 percent of the extant species at that\ntime. Some of the dominant phyla in the world\u2019s oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely. On land, the\ndisappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge, the dinosaurs.\nThe warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into\nevery conceivable niche in land, air, and water. Plants, too, radiated into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex\ncommunities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available.\nAnother mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period, bringing the Mesozoic Era to an end. Skies\ndarkened and temperatures fell after a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash ejected into the atmosphere blocked\nincoming sunlight. Plants died, herbivores and carnivores starved, and the dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to\nthe more warm-blooded mammals. In the following Cenozoic Era, mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once\noccupied by dinosaurs, and birds\u2014the warm-blooded direct descendants of one line of the ruling reptiles\u2014became aerial\nspecialists. The appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for pollinating insects, as\nwell as for birds and mammals. Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also\npromoted by a dramatic shift in Earth\u2019s geography, as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions, leaving\nsome animal groups isolated on islands and continents, or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other\ncompetitors. Early in the Cenozoic, new ecosystems appeared, with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs. Late in the\nCenozoic, further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then\nretreated, leaving new open spaces for colonization.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch the followingvideo(http://openstax.org/l/mass_extinction)to learn more about the mass extinctions.\nFigure27.19Extinctions.

However, one of the most ancestral groups of deuterostome invertebrates,\nthe Echinodermata, do produce tiny skeletal \u201cbones\u201d calledossiclesthat make up a trueendoskeleton, or\ninternal skeleton, covered by an epidermis.\nWe will start our investigation with the simplest of all the invertebrates\u2014animals sometimes classified\nwithin the clade Parazoa (\u201cbeside the animals\u201d). This clade currently includes only the phylum Placozoa\n(containing a single species,Trichoplax adhaerens), and the phylumPorifera, containing the more familiar\nsponges (Figure 28.2). The split between the Parazoa and the Eumetazoa (all animal clades above Parazoa)\nlikely took place over a billion years ago.\nWe should reiterate here that the Porifera do not possess \u201ctrue\u201d tissues that are embryologically homologous\nto those of all other derived animal groups such as the insects and mammals. This is because they do not\ncreate a true gastrula during embryogenesis, and as a result do not produce a true endoderm or ectoderm.\nBut even though they are not considered to have true tissues, they do have specialized cells that perform\nspecific functionslike tissues(for example, the external \u201cpinacoderm\u201d of a sponge acts like our epidermis).\nThus,functionally, the poriferans can be said to have tissues; however, these tissues are likely not\nembryologicallyhomologous to our own.\nSponge larvae (e.g, parenchymula and amphiblastula) are flagellated and able to swim; however, adults are\nnon-motile and spend their life attached to a substratum.

Water enters into the spongocoel through\nnumerous pores, orostia, that create openings in the body wall. Water entering the spongocoel is expelled\nvia a large common opening called theosculum.

Their food is trapped as water passes through the\nostia and out through the osculum. Bacteria smaller than 0.5 microns in size are trapped by choanocytes, which are the\nprincipal cells engaged in feeding, and are ingested by phagocytosis. However, particles that are larger than the ostia may be\nphagocytized at the sponge's surface by pinacocytes. In some sponges, amoebocytes transport food from cells that have ingested\nfood particles to those that do not. In sponges, in spite of what looks like a large digestive cavity, all digestion isintracellular.\nThe limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual sponge cells.\nAll other major body functions in the sponge (gas exchange, circulation, excretion) are performed by diffusion between the cells\nthat line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings. All cell types within the sponge\nobtain oxygen from water through diffusion. Likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion. In addition,\nnitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it\npasses through the sponge.\nSome sponges host green algae or cyanobacteria as endosymbionts within archeocytes and other cells. It may be a surprise to\nlearn that there are nearly 150 species of carnivorous sponges, which feed primarily on tiny crustaceans, snaring them through\nsticky threads or hooked spicules!\nAlthough there is no specialized nervous system in sponges, there is intercellular communication that can regulate events like\ncontraction of the sponge's body or the activity of the choanocytes.\nReproduction\nSponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods. The typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation\n(during this process, a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual), or budding\n(a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony). An\natypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation ofgemmules.\nGemmulesare environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges (e.g., in the freshwater spongeSpongilla). In\ngemmules, an inner layer of archeocytes (amoebocytes) is surrounded by a pneumatic cellular layer that may be reinforced with\nspicules. In freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature, and then\nserve to recolonize the habitat once environmental conditions improve and stabilize. Gemmules are capable of attaching to a\nsubstratum and generating a new sponge. Since gemmules can withstand harsh environments, are resistant to desiccation, and\n\n--- Page 748 ---\n728",

If the cnidocils are\ntouched, the hollow threads evert with enormous acceleration, approaching 40,000 times that of gravity. The microscopic\nthreads then either entangle the prey or instantly penetrate the flesh of the prey or predator, releasing toxins (including\nneurotoxins and pore-forming toxins that can lead to cell lysis) into the target, thereby immobilizing it or paralyzing it (see\nFigure 28.5).\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 749 ---",

(Figure 28.6).\nAn example of the polyp form is found in the genusHydra, whereas the most typical form of medusa is found in the group called\nthe \u201csea jellies\u201d (jellyfish). Polyp forms are sessile as adults, with a single opening (the mouth/anus) to the digestive cavity facing\nup with tentacles surrounding it. Medusa forms are motile, with the mouth and tentacles hanging down from an umbrella-\nshaped bell.\nFigure28.6Cnidarian body forms. Cnidarians have two distinct body plans, the medusa (a) and the polyp (b). All cnidarians have two\nmembrane layers, with a jelly-like mesoglea between them.\nSome cnidarians aredimorphic, that is, they exhibit both body plans during their life cycle. In these species, the polyp serves as\nthe asexual phase, while the medusa serves as the sexual stage and produces gametes. However, both body forms are diploid.\nAn example of cnidarian dimorphism can be seen in the colonial hydroidObelia. The sessile asexual colony has two types of\npolyps, shown inFigure 28.7. The first is thegastrozooid, which is adapted for capturing prey and feeding. InObelia, all polyps\nare connected through a common digestive cavity called acoenosarc. The other type of polyp is thegonozooid, adapted for the\nasexual budding and the production of sexual medusae. The reproductive buds from the gonozooid break off and mature into\nfree-swimming medusae, which are either male or female (dioecious).

In the gastrovascular cavity, extracellular digestion occurs as food is taken into the gastrovascular\ncavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients. However, some intracellular\ndigestion also occurs. The gastrovascular cavity distributes nutrients throughout the body of the animal, with nutrients passing\nfrom the digestive cavity across the mesoglea to the epidermal cells. Thus, this cavity serves both digestive and circulatory\nfunctions.\nCnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and water in the environment,\nand between cells in the gastrodermis and water in the gastrovascular cavity. The lack of a circulatory system to move dissolved\ngases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a non-living mesoglea between the layers. In the cnidarians with a\nthicker mesoglea, a number of canals help to distribute both nutrients and gases. There is neither an excretory system nor\norgans, and nitrogenous wastes simply diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or into the gastrovascular cavity.\nThe phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into two monophyletic clades: the Anthozoa and the\nMedusozoa. The Anthozoa include the corals, sea fans, sea whips, and the sea anemones. The Medusozoa include several classes\nof Cnidaria in two clades: The Hydrozoa include sessile forms, some medusoid forms, and swimming colonial forms like the\nPortuguese man-of-war. The other clade contains various types of jellies including both Scyphozoa and Cubozoa. The Anthozoa\ncontain only sessile polyp forms, while the Medusozoa include species with both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle.\nClass Anthozoa\nThe class Anthozoa (\"flower animals\") includes sea anemones (Figure 28.8), sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of\n6,100 described species. Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter. Individual\nanimals are cylindrical in shape and are attached directly to a substrate.\nFigure28.8Sea anemone. The sea anemone is shown (a) photographed and (b) in a diagram illustrating its morphology.

Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the\ngastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, calleddiverticuli. In some species, the digestive\nsystem may branch further intoradial canals. Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two\nfunctions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion, and to support the body of the animal.\nIn scyphozoans, nerve cells are organized in a nerve net that extends over the entire body, with a nerve ring around the edge of\nthe bell. Clusters of sensory organs called rhopalia may be present in pockets in the edge of the bell. Jellies have a ring of muscles\nlining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water, as well as to draw in food from\nthe water as they swim. Scyphozoans have separate sexes. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are\nexpelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form.\nThese polyps may bud to form additional polyps or begin immediately to produce medusa buds. In a few species, the planula\nlarva may develop directly into the medusa. The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of most scyphozoans includes both sexual medusoid and\nasexual polypoid body forms.\nFigure28.10Scyphozoan life cycle. The lifecycle of most jellyfish includes two stages: the medusa stage and the polyp stage. The polyp\nreproduces asexually by budding, and the medusa reproduces sexually. (credit \"medusa\": modification of work by Francesco Crippa)\nClass Cubozoa\nThis class includes jellies that have a box-shaped medusa, or a bell that is square in cross-section, and are colloquially known as\n\u201cbox jellyfish.\u201d These species may achieve sizes of 15 to 25 cm, but typically members of the Cubozoa are not as large as those of\nthe Scyphozoa. However, cubozoans display overall morphological and anatomical characteristics that are similar to those of the\nscyphozoans. A prominent difference between the two classes is the arrangement of tentacles. The cubozoans contain muscular\npads calledpedaliaat the corners of the square bell canopy, with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium. In some\ncases, the digestive system may extend into the pedalia. Nematocysts may be arranged in a spiral configuration along the\ntentacles; this arrangement helps to effectively subdue and capture prey. Cubozoans include the most venomous of all the\ncnidarians (Figure 28.11).\n\n--- Page 754 ---\n734",

(a) A blue Pseudoceros flatworm(Pseudoceros bifurcus); (b) gold speckled flatworm\n(Thysanozoon nigropapillosum). (credit a: modification of work by Stephen Childs; b: modification of work by Pril Fish.)\nFlatworms have three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to epidermal tissues (from ectoderm), the lining of the digestive\nsystem (from endoderm), and other internal tissues (from mesoderm). The epidermal tissue is a single layer of cells or a layer of\nfused cells (syncytium) that covers two layers of muscle, one circular and the other longitudinal. The mesodermal tissues include\nmesenchymal cells that contain collagen and support secretory cells that produce mucus and other materials at the surface.\nBecause flatworms are acoelomates, the mesodermal layer forms a solid mass between the outer epidermal surface and the\ncavity of the digestive system.\nPhysiological Processes of Flatworms\nThe free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers. Parasitic forms feed by absorbing nutrients provided by their\nhosts. Most flatworms, such as the planarian shown inFigure 28.14, have a branching gastrovascular cavity rather than a\ncomplete digestive system. In such animals, the \u201cmouth\u201d is also used to expel waste materials from the digestive system, and\nthus also serves as an anus. (A few species may have a second anal pore or opening.) The gut may be a simple sac or highly\nbranched. Digestion is primarily extracellular, with digested materials taken into the cells of the gut lining by phagocytosis. One\nparasitic group, the tapeworms (cestodes), lacks a digestive system altogether, and absorb digested food from the host.\nFlatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules attached toflame cells, whose cilia beat to direct waste fluids\nconcentrated in the tubules out of the body through excretory pores. The system is responsible for the regulation of dissolved\nsalts and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes. The nervous system consists of a pair of lateral nerve cords running the length of\nthe body with transverse connections between them. Two large cerebral ganglia\u2014concentrations of nerve cell bodies at the\nanterior end of the worm\u2014are associated with photosensory and chemosensory cells. There is neither a circulatory nor a\nrespiratory system, with gas and nutrient exchange dependent on diffusion and cell-to-cell junctions. This necessarily limits the\nthickness of the body in these organisms, constraining them to be \u201cflat\u201d worms. Most flatworm species aremonoecious(both\nmale and female reproductive organs are found in the same individual), and fertilization is typically internal. Asexual\nreproduction by fission is common in some groups.\n\n--- Page 758 ---\n738",

(b) The parasitic class\nMonogenea includesDactylogyrusspp, commonly called gill flukes, which are about 0.2 mm in length and have two anchors, indicated by\narrows used to attach the parasite on to the gills of host fish. (c) The class Trematoda includesFascioloides magna(right) andFasciola\nhepatica(two specimens on left, also known as the common liver fluke). (d) Class Cestoda includes tapeworms such as thisTaenia\nsaginata, infects both cattle and humans, and can reach 4 to 10 meters in length; the specimen shown here is about four meters long.\n(credit a: modification of work by Jan Derk; credit d: modification of work by CDC)\nMost free-living flatworms are marine polycladids, although tricladid species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial\nenvironments, and there are a number of members from other orders in both environments. The ventral epidermis of free-living\nflatworms is ciliated, which facilitates their locomotion. Some free-living flatworms are capable of remarkable feats of\nregeneration in which an individual may regrow its head or tail after being severed, or even several heads if the planaria is cut\nlengthwise.\nThe monogeneans areectoparasites, mostly of fish, with simple life cycles that consist of a free-swimming larva that attaches to\na fish, prior to its transformation to the ectoparasitic adult form. The parasite has only one host and that host is usually very\nspecific. The worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues, or they may simply graze on surface mucus and skin\nparticles. Most monogeneans are hermaphroditic, but the male gametes develop first and so cross-fertilization is quite\ncommon.\nThe trematodes, or flukes, are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups, including humans. Trematodes have\ncomplex life cycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs, and one or more secondary hosts in which\nasexual reproduction occurs. The primary host is usually a vertebrate and the secondary host is almost always a mollusk, in\nwhich multiple larvae are produced asexually. Trematodes, which attached internally to the host via an oral and medial sucker,\nare responsible for serious human diseases including schistosomiasis, caused by several species of the blood fluke,Schistosoma\n\n--- Page 760 ---\n740",

Undoubtedly the rotifers will continue to be\nrevised as more phylogenetic evidence becomes available.\nThe pseudocoelomate body of a rotifer is remarkably complex for such a small animal (roughly the size of aParamecium) and is\ndivided into three sections: ahead(which contains the corona), atrunk(which contains most of the internal organs), and the\nfoot. A cuticle, rigid in some species and flexible in others, covers the body surface. They have both skeletal muscle associated\nwith locomotion and visceral muscles associated with the gut, both composed of single cells.

This enormous phylum includes chitons, tusk shells, snails, slugs, nudibranchs, sea butterflies,\nclams, mussels, oysters, squids, octopuses, and nautiluses. Molluscs display a wide range of morphologies in each class and\nsubclass, but share a few key characteristics (Figure 28.21). The chief locomotor structure is usually a muscularfoot. Most\ninternal organs are contained in a region called thevisceral mass. Overlying the visceral mass is a fold of tissue called the\nmantle; within the cavity formed by the mantle are respiratory structures calledgills, that typically fold over the visceral mass.\nThe mouths of most mollusks, except bivalves (e.g., clams) contain a specialized feeding organ called aradula, an abrasive\ntonguelike structure. Finally, the mantle secretes a calcium-carbonate-hardened shell in most molluscs, although this is greatly\nreduced in the class Cephalopoda, which contains the octopuses and squids.\n\n--- Page 766 ---\n746",

This chiton from the class Polyplacaphora has the eight-plated shell for which its class is named. (credit: Jerry\nKirkhart)\nClass Bivalvia (\u201ctwo-valves\u201d) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, geoducks, and shipworms. Some bivalves are almost\nmicroscopic, while others, in the genusTridacna,may be one meter in length and weigh 225 kilograms. Members of this class\nare found in marine as well as freshwater habitats. As the name suggests, bivalves are enclosed in two-part valves or shells\n(Figure 28.23a) fused on the dorsal side by hinge ligaments as well as shell teeth on the ventral side that keep the two halves\naligned. The two shells, which consist of an outer organic layer, a middle prismatic layer, and a very smooth nacreous layer, are\njoined at the oldest part of the shell called the umbo. Anterior and posterior adductor and abductor muscles close and open the\nshell respectively.\nThe overall body of the bivalve is laterally flattened; the foot is wedge-shaped; and the head region is poorly developed (with no\nobvious mouth). Bivalves are filter-feeders, and a radula is absent in this class of mollusks. The mantle cavity is fused along the\nedges except for openings for the foot and for the intake and expulsion of water, which is circulated through the mantle cavity by\nthe actions of the incurrent and excurrent siphons. During water intake by the incurrent siphon, food particles are captured by\nthe paired posterior gills (ctenidia) and then carried by the movement of cilia forward to the mouth. Excretion and\nosmoregulation are performed by a pair of nephridia. Eyespots and other sensory structures are located along the edge of the\n\n--- Page 768 ---\n748",

The strange arrangement that results from torsion poses a serious sanitation\nproblem by creating the possibility of wastes being washed back over the gills, causingfouling.There is actually no really perfect\nexplanation for the embryonic development of torsion, and some groups that formerly exhibited torsion in their ancestral\ngroups are now known to have reversed the process.\nGastropods also have a foot that is modified for crawling. Most gastropods have a well-defined head with tentacles and eyes. A\ncomplex radula is used to scrape up food particles. In aquatic gastropods, the mantle cavity encloses the gills (ctenidia), but in\nland gastropods, the mantle itself is the major respiratory structure, acting as a kind of lung.Nephridia(\u201ckidneys\u201d) are also\nfound in the mantle cavity.\nFigure28.25Torsion in gastropods. During embryonic development of some gastropods, the visceral mass undergoes torsion, or\ncounterclockwise rotation of the visceral anatomical features. As a result, the anus of the adult animal is located over the head. Although\ntorsion is always counterclockwise, the shell may coil in either direction; thus coiling of a shell isnotthe same as torsion of the visceral\nmass.\nEveryday Connection\nCan Snail Venom Be Used as a Pharmacological Painkiller?\nMarine snails of the genusConus(Figure 28.26) attack prey with a venomous stinger, modified from the radula. The toxin\nreleased, known as conotoxin, is a peptide with internal disulfide linkages. Conotoxins can bring about paralysis in\nhumans, indicating that this toxin attacks neurological targets. Some conotoxins have been shown to block neuronal ion\nchannels. These findings have led researchers to study conotoxins for possible medical applications.\nConotoxins are an exciting area of potential pharmacological development, since these peptides may be possibly modified\nand used in specific medical conditions to inhibit the activity of specific neurons. For example, conotoxins or modifications\nof them may be used to induce paralysis in muscles in specific health applications, similar to the use of botulinum toxin.\nSince the entire spectrum of conotoxins, as well as their mechanisms of action, is not completely known, the study of their\npotential applications is still in its infancy. Most research to date has focused on their use to treat neurological diseases.\nThey have also shown some efficacy in relieving chronic pain, and the pain associated with conditions like sciatica and\nshingles.

The nerve cord is ventral in position and bears enlarged nodes\nor ganglia in each segment.\nFigure28.30Segmental anatomy of an earthworm. This schematic drawing shows the basic anatomy of annelids in a cross-sectional view.\nAnnelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads (as in earthworms and leeches) or dioecious with temporary or\nseasonal gonads (as in polychaetes). However, cross-fertilization is preferred even in hermaphroditic animals. Earthworms may\nshow simultaneous mutual fertilization when they are aligned for copulation. Some leeches change their sex over their\nreproductive lifetimes. In most polychaetes, fertilization is external and development includes a trochophore larva, which then\nmetamorphoizes to the adult form. In oligochaetes, fertilization is typically internal and the fertilized eggs develop in a cocoon\nproduced by the clitellum; development is direct. Polychaetes are excellent regenerators and some even reproduce asexually by\nbudding or fragmentation.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis combinationvideo and animation(http://shapeoflife.org/video/animation/annelid-animation-body-plan)provides a close-\nup look at annelid anatomy.\nClassification of Phylum Annelida\nPhylum Annelida contains the class Polychaeta (the polychaetes) and the class Oligochaeta (the earthworms, leeches, and their\nrelatives). The earthworms and the leeches form a monophyletic clade within the polychaetes, which are therefore paraphyletic\nas a group.\nThere are more than 22,000 different species of annelids, and more than half of these are marine polychaetes (\"many bristles\").\nIn the polychaetes, bristles are arranged in clusters on their parapodia\u2014fleshy, flat, paired appendages that protrude from each\nsegment. Many polychaetes use their parapodia to crawl along the sea floor, but others are adapted for swimming or floating.\nSome are sessile, living in tubes. Some polychaetes live near hydrothermal vents. These deepwater tubeworms have no digestive\ntract, but have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria living in their bodies.\nEarthworms are the most abundant members of the class Oligochaeta (\"few bristles\"), distinguished by the presence of a\npermanent clitellum as well as the small number of reduced chaetae on each segment. (Recall that oligochaetes do not have\nparapodia.) The oligochaete subclass Hirudinea, includes leeches such as the medicinal leech,Hirudo medicinalis, which is\neffective at increasing blood circulation and breaking up blood clots, and thus can be used to treat some circulatory disorders\nand cardiovascular diseases. Their use goes back thousands of years. These animals produce a seasonal clitellum, unlike the\npermanent clitellum of other oligochaetes. A significant difference between leeches and other annelids is the lack of setae and\nthe development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends, which are used to attach to the host animal. Additionally, in\nleeches, the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to the internal segmentation of the coelomic cavity. This\nadaptation possibly helps the leeches to elongate when they ingest copious quantities of blood from host vertebrates, a condition\nin which they are said to be \u201cengorged.\u201d The subclass Brachiobdella includes tiny leechlike worms that attach themselves to the\n\n--- Page 774 ---\n754",

This is because it contains two of the most diverse\nanimal groups: phylum Nematoda (the roundworms) and phylum Arthropoda (the arthropods). The most prominent\ndistinguishing feature of ecdysozoans is the cuticle\u2014a tough, but flexible exoskeleton that protects these animals from water\nloss, predators, and other dangers of the external environment. One small phylum within the Ecdysozoa, with exceptional\nresistance to desiccation and other environmental hazards, is the Tardigrada. The nematodes, tardigrades, and arthropods all\nbelong to the superphylum Ecdysozoa, which is believed to bemonophyletic\u2014a clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants\nfrom one common ancestor. All members of this superphylum periodically go through a molting process that culminates in\necdysis\u2014the actual shedding of the old exoskeleton. (The term \u201cecdysis\u201d translates roughly as \u201ctake off\u201d or \u201cstrip.\u201d) During the\nmolting process, old cuticle is replaced by a new cuticle, which is secreted beneath it, and which will last until the next growth\nperiod.\nPhylum Nematoda\nThe Nematoda, like other members of the superphylum Ecdysozoa, are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm that is\nsandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm. They are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section\nwill divide them into right and left sides that are superficially symmetrical. In contrast with flatworms, nematodes are\npseudocoelomates and show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. Nematodes include both free-living and parasitic\nforms.\nIn 1914, N.A. Cobb said, \u201cIn short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still\nbe dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales,\nrivers, lakes and oceans represented by a thin film of nematodes...\u201d To paraphrase Cobb, nematodes are so abundant that if all\nthe non-nematode matter of the biosphere were removed, there would still remain a shadow of the former world outlined by\nnematodes!1The phylum Nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature.\nHowever, nematologists believe there may be over one million unclassified species.\nThe name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word \u201cNemos,\u201d which means \u201cthread,\u201d and includes all true roundworms.\nNematodes are present in all habitats, typically with each species occurring in great abundance. The free-living nematode,\nCaenorhabditis elegans, has been extensively used as a model system for many different avenues of biological inquiry in\nlaboratories all over the world.\n1Stoll, N.

These animals have a complete digestive system with a\ndistinct mouth and anus, whereas only one opening is present in the digestive tract of flatworms. The mouth opens into a\nmuscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. The epidermis can be either a\nsingle layer of cells or asyncytium\u2014a multinucleated tissue that in this case is formed by the fusion of many single cells. The\ncuticle of nematodes is rich in collagen and a polymer calledchitin, which forms a protective armor outside the epidermis. The\ncuticle extends into both ends of the digestive tract, the pharynx, and rectum. In the head, an anterior mouth opening is\ncomposed of three (or six) \u201clips\u201d as well as teeth derived from the cuticle (in some species). Some nematodes may present other\nmodifications of the cuticle such as rings, head shields, or warts. These external rings, however, do not reflecttrueinternal body\nsegmentation, which as we have seen is a hallmark of phylum Annelida. The attachment of the muscles of nematodes differs\nfrom that of most animals: they have a longitudinal layer only, and their direct attachment to the dorsal and ventral nerve cords\ncreates a strong muscular contraction that results in a whiplike, almost spastic, body movement.\nFigure28.32Nematode morphology.

In some nematodes, osmoregulation and salt balance are performed by simple excretory\ncells or glands that may be connected to paired canals that release wastes through an anterior pore. In marine nematodes, the\nexcretory cells are calledrenette cells, which are unique to nematodes.\nNervous system\nMost nematodes have four longitudinal nerve cords that run along the length of the body in dorsal, ventral, and lateral\npositions.

(2012) -https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=22716809(http://openstax.org/l/waterbear))\nMorphology and Physiology\nTardigrades have cylindrical bodies, with four pairs of legs terminating in a number of claws. The cuticle is periodically shed,\nincluding the cuticular covering of the claws. The first three pairs of legs are used for walking, and the posterior pair for clinging\nto the substrate. A circular mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and salivary glands. Tardigrades feed on plants, algae, or small\nanimals. Plant cells are pierced with a chitinous stylet and the cellular contents are then sucked into the gut by the muscular\npharynx. Bands of single muscle cells are attached to the various points of the epidermis and extend into the legs to provide\nambulatory movement. The major body cavity is ahemocoel, but there are no specialized circulatory structures for moving the\nblood, nor are there specialized respiratory structures. Malpighian tubules in the hemocoel remove metabolic wastes and\ntransport them to the gut. A dorsal brain is connected to a ventral nerve cord with segmental ganglia associated with the\nappendages. Sensory structures are greatly reduced, but there is a pair of simple eyespots on the head, and sensory cilia or\nbristles concentrated toward the head end of the animal.\nReproduction\nMost tardigrades are dioecious, and males and females each have a single gonad. Mating usually occurs at the time of a molt and\nfertilization is external. Eggs may be deposited in a molted cuticle or attached to other objects. Development is direct, and the\nanimal may molt a dozen times during its lifetime. In tardigrades, like nematodes, development produces a fixed number of\ncells, with the actual number of cells being dependent on the species. Further growth occurs by enlarging the cells, not by\nmultiplying them.",

Their name \"trilobite\" refers to thethree\nlongitudinal lobesmaking up the body: right pleural lobe, axial lobe, and left pleural lobe (credit: Kevin Walsh).\nMorphology\nCharacteristic features of the arthropods include the presence of jointed appendages, body segmentation, and chitinized\nexoskeleton. Fusion of adjacent groups of segments gave rise to functional body regions called tagmata (singular = tagma).\nTagmata may be in the form of a head, thorax, and abdomen, or a cephalothorax and abdomen, or a head and trunk, depending\non the taxon. Commonly described tagmata may be composed of different numbers of segments; for example, the head of most\ninsects results from the fusion of six ancestral segments, whereas the \u201chead\u201d of another arthropod may be made of fewer\nancestral segments, due to independent evolutionary events. Jointed arthropod appendages, often in segmental pairs, have been\nspecialized for various functions: sensing their environment (antennae), capturing and manipulating food (mandibles and\nmaxillae), as well as for walking, jumping, digging, and swimming.\nIn the arthropod body, a central cavity, called thehemocoel(or blood cavity), is present, and the hemocoel fluids are moved by\ncontraction of regions of the tubular dorsal blood vessel called \"hearts.\" Groups of arthropods also differ in the organs used for\nnitrogenous waste excretion, with crustaceans possessinggreen glandsand insects usingMalpighian tubules, which work in\nconjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body of nitrogenous waste.

Beeson)\nIn most crustaceans, the head and thorax is fused to form acephalothorax(Figure 28.43), which is covered by a plate called the\ncarapace, thus producing a body plan comprising two tagmata:cephalophoraxandabdomen. Crustaceans have a chitinous\nexoskeleton that is shed by molting and ecdysis whenever the animal requires an increase in size or the next stage of\ndevelopment. The exoskeletons of many aquatic species are also infused with calcium carbonate, which makes them even\nstronger than those of other arthropods. Crustaceans have an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the hemocoel\nby the dorsally located heart. Hemocyanin is the major respiratory pigment present in crustaceans, but hemoglobin is found in a\nfew species and both are dissolved in the hemolymph rather than carried in cells.\nFigure28.43Crustacean anatomy.

The notocord is located between the\ndigestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides rigid skeletal support as well as a flexible location for attachment of axial\nmuscles. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime.\nHowever, in vertebrates (craniates), the notochord is present only during embryonic development, at which time it induces the\ndevelopment of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not\nfound in the postembryonic stages of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (that is, the spine).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure29.3Chordate features. In chordates, four common features appear at some point during development: a notochord, a dorsal\nhollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. The endostyle is embedded in the floor of the pharynx.\nWhich of the following statements about common features of chordates is true?\n1. The dorsal hollow nerve cord is part of the chordate central nervous system.\n2. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits become the gills.\n3. Humans are not chordates because humans do not have a tail.\n4. Vertebrates do not have a notochord at any point in their development; instead, they have a vertebral column.\n5. The endostyle secretes steroid hormones.\nThedorsal hollow nerve cordis derived from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development. In chordates, it is\nlocated dorsally to the notochord. In contrast, the nervous system in protostome animal phyla is characterized by solid nerve\ncords that are located either ventrally and/or laterally to the gut. In vertebrates, the neural tube develops into the brain and\nspinal cord, which together comprise the central nervous system (CNS). The peripheral nervous system (PNS) refers to the\nperipheral nerves (including the cranial nerves) lying outside of the brain and spinal cord.\nPharyngeal slitsare openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment. In\norganisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding.\nSome invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth. The endostyle is a\nstrip of ciliated mucus-producing tissue in the floor of the pharynx. Food particles trapped in the mucus are moved along the\nendostyle toward the gut. The endostyle also produces substances similar to thyroid hormones and is homologous with the\nthyroid gland in vertebrates. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, into\njaw supports. In tetrapods (land vertebrates), the slits are highly modified into components of the ear, and tonsils and thymus\nglands. In other vertebrates, pharyngeal arches, derived from all three germ layers, give rise to the oral jaw from the first\npharyngeal arch, with the second arch becoming the hyoid and jaw support.\nThepost-anal tailis a posterior elongation of the body, extending beyond the anus. The tail contains skeletal elements and\nmuscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species, such as fishes. In some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail also\nhelps with balance, courting, and signaling when danger is near. In humans and other great apes, the post-anal tail is reduced\nto a vestigial coccyx (\u201ctail bone\u201d) that aids in balance during sitting.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick for a video discussing the evolution of chordates and five characteristics that they share.\nClick to view content(https://www.openstax.org/l/chordate_evol)\n\n--- Page 802 ---\n782",

Fishes were the earliest\nvertebrates, with jawless species being the earliest forms and jawed species evolving later. They are active feeders, rather than\nsessile, suspension feeders. The Agnatha (jawless fishes)\u2014the hagfishes and lampreys\u2014have a distinct cranium and complex\nsense organs including eyes, that distinguish them from the invertebrate chordates, the urochordates and cephalochordates.\nJawless Fishes: Superclass Agnatha\nJawless fishes (Agnatha) are craniates representing an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over 550 million years ago. In the\npast, hagfishes and lampreys were sometimes recognized as separate clades within the Agnatha, primarily because lampreys\nwere regarded as true vertebrates, whereas hagfishes were not. However, recent molecular data, both from rRNA and mtDNA,\nas well as embryological data, provide strong support for the hypothesis that living agnathans\u2014previously called\ncyclostomes\u2014are monophyletic, and thus share recent common ancestry. The discussion below, for convenience, separates the\nmodern \u201ccyclostomes\u201d into the class Myxini and class Petromyzontida. The defining features of the living jawless fishes are the\nlack of jaws and lack of paired lateral appendages (fins). They also lack internal ossification and scales, although these are not\ndefining features of the clade.\nSome of the earliest jawless fishes were the armored ostracoderms (which translates to \u201cshell-skin\u201d): vertebrate fishes encased in\nbony armor\u2014unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales. Some ostracoderms, also unlike living jawless\nfishes, may have had paired fins. We should note, however, that the \u201costracoderms\u201d represent an assemblage of heavily armored\nextinct jawless fishes that may not form a natural evolutionary group. Fossils of the genusHaikouichthysfrom China, with an\nage of about 530 million years, show many typical vertebrate characteristics including paired eyes, auditory capsules, and\nrudimentary vertebrae.\nClass Myxini: Hagfishes\nThe classMyxiniincludes at least 70 species of hagfishes\u2014eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on living or\ndead invertebrates, fishes, and marine mammals (Figure 29.9). Although they are almost completely blind, sensory barbels\naround the mouth help them locate food by smell and touch. They feed using keratinized teeth on a movable cartilaginous plate\nin the mouth, which rasp pieces of flesh from their prey. These feeding structures allow the gills to be used exclusively for\nrespiration,notfor filter feeding as in the urochordates and cephalochordates. Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in\noceans around the world, except for the polar regions. Unique slime glands beneath the skin release a milky mucus (through\nsurface pores) that upon contact with water becomes incredibly slippery, making the animal almost impossible to hold. This\nslippery mucus thus allows the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. Hagfish can also twist their bodies into a knot,\nwhich provides additional leverage to feed. Sometimes hagfish enter the bodies of dead animals and eat carcasses from the\ninside out! Interestingly, they do not have a stomach!\n\n--- Page 806 ---\n786",

In fact,\none of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw: a hinged structure\nattached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food. Jaws were probably derived from the first pair of gill\narches supporting the gills of jawless fishes.\nEarly gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins, allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately. Pectoral fins are typically\nlocated on the anterior body, and pelvic fins on the posterior. Evolution of the jaw and paired fins permitted gnathostomes to\nexpand their food options from the scavenging and suspension feeding of jawless fishes to active predation. The ability of\ngnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources probably contributed to their replacing most jawless fishes during the Devonian\nperiod. Two early groups of gnathostomes were theacanthodiansandplacoderms(Figure 29.11), which arose in the late Silurian\nperiod and are now extinct. Most modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes\n(which include the class Actinoptertygii and class Sarcopterygii).\nFigure29.11A placoderm.Dunkleosteuswas an enormous placoderm from the Devonian period, 380 to 360 million years ago. It\nmeasured up to 10 meters in length and weighed up to 3.6 tons. Its head and neck were armored with heavy bony plates. Although\nDunkleosteushad no true teeth, the edge of the jaw was armed with sharp bony blades. (credit: Nobu Tamura)\nClass Chondrichthyes: Cartilaginous Fishes\nThe class Chondrichthyes (about 1,000 species) is a morphologically diverse clade, consisting of subclass Elasmobranchii (sharks\n[Figure 29.12], rays, and skates, together with the obscure and critically endangered sawfishes), and a few dozen species of\nfishes calledchimaeras, or \u201cghost sharks\u201d in the subclass Holocephali. Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins\nand a skeleton made of cartilage. This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian. They are\nthought to be descended from the placoderms, which had endoskeletons made of bone; thus, the lighter cartilaginous skeleton\nof Chondrichthyes is a secondarily derived evolutionary development. Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of\ncalcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone.\nMost cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives. Most\nsharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces.\nSharks have abrasive skin covered with tooth-like scales called placoid scales. Shark teeth probably evolved from rows of these\nscales lining the mouth. A few species of sharks and rays, like the enormous whale shark (Figure 29.13), are suspension feeders\nthat feed on plankton. The sawfishes have an extended rostrum that looks like a double-edged saw. The rostrum is covered with\nelectrosensitive pores that allow the sawfish to detect slight movements of prey hiding in the muddy sea floor. The teeth in the\nrostrum are actually modified tooth-like structures called denticles, similar to scales.\n\n--- Page 808 ---\n788",

They also have three pairs of semicircular canals, and excellent senses of smell, vibration, vision, and electroreception.\nA very large lobed liver producessqualene oil(a lightweight biochemical precursor to steroids) that serves to aid in buoyancy\n(because with a specific gravity of 0.855, it is lighter than that of water).\nRays and skates comprise more than 500 species. They are closely related to sharks but can be distinguished from sharks by their\nflattened bodies, pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head, and gill slits on their ventral surface (Figure 29.15). Like\nsharks, rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton. Most species are marine and live on the sea floor, with nearly a worldwide\ndistribution.\nUnlike the stereotypical sharks and rays, the Holocephali (chimaeras or ratfish) have adiphycercaltail (equally sized fin lobes,\nwith the tail vertebrae located between them), lack scales (lost secondarily in evolution), and have teeth modified as grinding\nplates that are used to feed on mollusks and other invertebrates (Figure 29.15b). Unlike sharks with elasmobranch or naked gills,\nchimaeras have four pairs of gills covered by an operculum. Many species have a pearly iridescence and are extremely pretty.\nFigure29.15Cartilaginous fish. (a) Stingray. This stingray blends into the sandy bottom of the ocean floor.

The vast majority of present-\nday fishes belong to this group, which consists of approximately 30,000 species, making it the largest class of vertebrates in\nexistence today.\nNearly all bony fishes have anossified skeletonwith specialized bone cells (osteocytes) that produce and maintain a calcium\nphosphate matrix. This characteristic has been reversed only in a few groups of Osteichthyes, such as sturgeons and paddlefish,\n\n--- Page 810 ---\n790",

In some species of salamanders, hindlimbs are\nreduced or absent, but all caecilians are (secondarily) limbless. An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist,\npermeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands. Most water is taken in across the skin rather than by drinking. The skin is also\none of three respiratory surfaces used by amphibians. The other two are the lungs and the buccal (mouth) cavity. Air is taken first\ninto the mouth through the nostrils, and then pushed by positive pressure into the lungs by elevating the throat and closing the\nnostrils.\nAll extant adult amphibians are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue used to capture prey.\nAmphibians also have multiple small teeth at the edge of the jaws. In salamanders and caecilians, teeth are present in both jaws,\nsometimes in multiple rows. In frogs and toads, teeth are seen only in the upper jaw. Additional teeth, calledvomerine teeth,\nmay be found in the roof of the mouth. Amphibian teeth arepedicellate, which means that the root and crown are calcified,\nseparated by a zone of noncalcified tissue.\nAmphibians have image-forming eyes and color vision. Ears are best developed in frogs and toads, which vocalize to\ncommunicate. Frogs use separate regions of the inner ear for detecting higher and lower sounds: thepapilla amphibiorum,\nwhich is sensitive to frequencies below 10,000 hertz and unique to amphibians, and thepapilla basilaris, which is sensitive to\nhigher frequencies, including mating calls, transmitted from the eardrum through the stapes bone. Amphibians also have an\nextra bone in the ear, the operculum, which transmits low-frequency vibrations from the forelimbs and shoulders to the inner\near, and may be used for the detection of seismic signals.\nEvolution of Amphibians\nThe fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods: now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago.\nEvolution of tetrapods from lobe-finned freshwater fishes (similar to coelacanths and lungfish) represented a significant change\nin body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water, to organisms that breathed air and moved onto\nland; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period.\nAquatic tetrapods of the Devonian period includeIchthyostegaandAcanthostega. Both were aquatic, and may have had both\ngills and lungs. They also had four limbs, with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods, including\namphibians. However, the limbs could not be pulled in under the body and would not have supported their bodies well out of\nwater. They probably lived in shallow freshwater environments, and may have taken brief terrestrial excursions, much like\n\u201cwalking\u201d catfish do today in Florida. InIchthyostega, the forelimbs were more developed than the hind limbs, so it might have\ndragged itself along when it ventured onto land. What precededAcanthostegaandIchthyostega?\nIn 2006, researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a \u201ctetrapod-like fish,\u201dTiktaalik roseae, which seems to be a\nmorphologically \u201cintermediate form\u201d between sarcopterygian fishes having feet-like fins and early tetrapods having true limbs\n(Figure 29.17).Tiktaaliklikely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago.2Tiktaalik also had gills and\nlungs, but the loss of some gill elements gave it a neck, which would have allowed its head to move sideways for feeding. The eyes\nwere on top of the head. It had fins, but the attachment of the fin bones to the shoulder suggested they might be weight-\nbearing. Tiktaalik precededAcanthostegaandIchthyostega, with their four limbs, by about 10 million years and is considered to\nbe a true intermediate clade between fish and amphibians.\n2Daeschler, E.

Anurans are among the most diverse\ngroups of vertebrates, with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica. Anurans, ranging\nfrom the minute New Guinea frog at 7 mm to the huge goliath frog at 32 cm from tropical Africa, have a body plan that is more\nspecialized for movement. Adult frogs use their hind limbs and their arrow-like endoskeleton to jump accurately to capture prey\non land. Tree frogs have hands adapted for grasping branches as they climb. In tropical areas, \u201cflying frogs\u201d can glide from perch\nto perch on the extended webs of their feet. Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including\nskin that acts as camouflage. Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals that are poisonous to\npredators from glands in the skin. Frogs with more toxic skins have bright warning (aposematic) coloration.\nFigure29.19Tree frog. The Australian green tree frog is a nocturnal predator that lives in the canopies of trees near a water source.\nFrog eggs are fertilized externally, and like other amphibians, frogs generally lay their eggs in moist environments. Although\namphibian eggs are protected by a thick jelly layer, they would still dehydrate quickly in a dry environment. Frogs demonstrate a\ngreat diversity of parental behaviors, with some species laying many eggs and exhibiting little parental care, to species that carry\neggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or embedded in their backs. The males of Darwin's frog carry tadpoles in their vocal sac.\nMany tree frogs lay their eggs off the ground in a folded leaf located over water so that the tadpoles can drop into the water as\nthey hatch.\nThe life cycle of most frogs, as other amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to\nan adult stage. However, the eggs of frogs in the genusEleutherodactylusdevelop directly into little froglets, guarded by a\nparent. The larval stage of a frog, the tadpole, is often a filter-feeding herbivore. Tadpoles usually have gills, a lateral line system,\n\n--- Page 814 ---\n794",

Both\nGondwana and the continent Laurentia were located near the equator.\nDuring the early Paleozoic, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was much greater than it is today. This may have\nbegun to change later, as land plants became more common. As the roots of land plants began to infiltrate rock and soil began to\nform, carbon dioxide was drawn out of the atmosphere and became trapped in the rock. This reduced the levels of carbon\ndioxide and increased the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, so that by the end of the Paleozoic, atmospheric conditions were\nsimilar to those of today.\nAs plants became more common through the latter half of the Paleozoic, microclimates began to emerge and ecosystems began\nto change. As plants and ecosystems continued to grow and become more complex, vertebrates moved from the water to land.\nThe presence of shoreline vegetation may have contributed to the movement of vertebrates onto land. One hypothesis suggests\nthat the fins of aquatic vertebrates were used to maneuver through this vegetation, providing a precursor to the movement of\nfins on land and the further development of limbs. The late Paleozoic was a time of diversification of vertebrates, as amniotes\nemerged and became two different lines that gave rise, on one hand, to synapsids and mammals, and, on the other hand, to the\ncodonts, reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds. Many marine vertebrates became extinct near the end of the Devonian period, which\nended about 360 million years ago, and both marine and terrestrial vertebrates were decimated by a mass extinction in the early\nPermian period about 250 million years ago.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nViewEarth\u2019s Paleogeography: Continental Movements Through Time(http://openstax.org/l/paleogeography)to see changes in\nEarth as life evolved.",

The\nearly amniotes quickly diverged into two main lines:synapsidsandsauropsids.Synapsidsincluded thetherapsids, a clade from\nwhich mammals evolved.Sauropsidswere further divided intoanapsidsanddiapsids. Diapsids gave rise to the reptiles,\nincluding the dinosaurs and birds. The key differences between the synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids are the structures of the\nskull and the number oftemporal fenestrae(\u201cwindows\u201d) behind each eye (Figure 29.23).Temporal fenestraeare post-orbital\nopenings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen. Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae, synapsids have one\n(fused ancestrally from two fenestrae), and diapsids have two (although many diapsids such as birds have highly modified\ndiapsid skulls). Anapsids include extinct organisms and traditionally included turtles. However, more recent molecular and\nfossil evidence clearly shows that turtles arose within the diapsid line and secondarily lost the temporal fenestrae; thus they\nappear to be anapsids because modern turtles do not have fenestrae in the temporal bones of the skull. The canonical diapsids\ninclude dinosaurs, birds, and all other extinct and living reptiles.\nFigure29.23Amniote skulls. Compare the skulls and temporal fenestrae of anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids. Anapsids have no openings,\nsynapsids have one opening, and diapsids have two openings.\nThe diapsids in turn diverged into two groups, theArchosauromorpha(\u201cancient lizard form\u201d) and theLepidosauromorpha\n(\u201cscaly lizard form\u201d) during the Mesozoic period (Figure 29.24).

(We should note that clade Dinosauria includes\nbirds, which evolved from a branch of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs in the Mesozoic.)\nThe evolutionarily derived characteristics of amniotes include the amniotic egg and its four extraembryonic membranes, a\nthicker and more waterproof skin, and rib ventilation of the lungs (ventilation is performed by drawing air into and out of the\nlungs by muscles such as the costal rib muscles and the diaphragm).\n\n--- Page 818 ---\n798",

In\ncrocodilians, the lung chamber is expanded and contracted by moving the liver, which is attached to the pelvis. Turtles have a\nspecial problem with breathing, because their rib cage cannot expand. However, they can change the pressure around the lungs\nby pulling their limbs in and out of the shell, and by moving their internal organs. Some turtles also have a posterior respiratory\nsac that opens off the hindgut that aids in the diffusion of gases.\nMost reptiles areectotherms, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment; however, some\ncrocodilians maintain elevatedthoracictemperatures and thus appear to be at least regionalendotherms. This is in contrast to\ntrue endotherms, which use heat produced by metabolism and muscle contraction to regulate body temperature over a very\nnarrow temperature range, and thus are properly referred to ashomeotherms. Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help\nregulate body temperature, such as basking in sunny places to warm up through the absorption of solar radiation, or finding\nshady spots or going underground to minimize the absorption of solar radiation, which allows them to cool down and prevent\noverheating. The advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body; therefore, reptiles\ncan survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm. In cold weather, some reptiles such as\nthe garter snakebrumate.Brumationis similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long\nperiods without eating, but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves. Rather,\ntheir metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures, and the animal is very sluggish.\nEvolution of Reptiles\nReptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. One of the oldest known amniotes is\nCasineria, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. One of the earliest undisputed reptile fossils was\nHylonomus, a lizardlike animal about 20 cm long. Soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three\ngroups\u2014synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids\u2014during the Permian period. The Permian period also saw a second major\ndivergence of diapsid reptiles into stem archosaurs (predecessors of thecodonts, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds) and\nlepidosaurs (predecessors of snakes and lizards). These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period, when the\narchosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group possibly due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during\nthe Permian-Triassic extinction. About 250 million years ago, archosaurs radiated into the pterosaurs and both saurischian\n\u201clizard hip\u201d and ornithischian \u201cbird-hip\u201d dinosaurs (see below).\nAlthough they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs, thepterosaurswere distinct from true dinosaurs (Figure 29.25).\nPterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight, including hollow bones (birds also exhibit hollow bones, a case\nof convergent evolution).

There are the 25 species of Crocodilia, two\nspecies of Sphenodontia, approximately 9,200 Squamata species, and about 325 species of Testudines.\nCrocodilia\nCrocodilia(\u201csmall lizard\u201d) arose as a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic; extant species include alligators, crocodiles,\ngharials, and caimans. Crocodilians (Figure 29.27) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa, South America, Southern\nFlorida, Asia, and Australia. They are found in freshwater, saltwater, and brackish habitats, such as rivers and lakes, and spend\nmost of their time in water. Crocodiles are descended from terrestrial reptiles and can still walk and run well on land. They often\nmove on their bellies in a swimming motion, propelled by alternate movements of their legs. However, some species can lift\ntheir bodies off the ground, pulling their legs in under the body with their feet rotated to face forward. This mode of locomotion\ntakes a lot of energy, and seems to be used primarily to clear ground obstacles. Amazingly, some crocodiles can also gallop,\npushing off with their hind legs and moving their hind and forelegs alternately in pairs. Galloping crocodiles have been clocked\nat speeds over 17 kph and, over short distances, in an ambush situation, they can easily chase down most humans if they are\ntaken by surprise. However, they are short distance runners, not interested in a long chase, and most fit humans can probably\noutrun them in a sprint (assuming they respond quickly to the ambush!).\n\n--- Page 822 ---\n802",

Some lizards, like\nchameleons (Figure 29.29), can change their skin color by redistributing pigment withinchromatophoresin their skins.\nChameleons change color both for camouflage and for social signaling. Lizards have multiple-colored oil droplets in their retinal\ncells that give them a good range of color vision. Lizards, unlike snakes, can focus their eyes by changing the shape of the lens.\nThe eyes of chameleons can move independently. Several species of lizards have a \"hidden\"parietal eye, similar to that in the\ntuatara. Both lizards and snakes use their tongues to sample the environment and a pit in the roof of the mouth, Jacobson's\norgan, is used to evaluate the collected sample.\nMost lizards are carnivorous, but some large species, such as iguanas, are herbivores. Some predatory lizards are ambush\npredators, waiting quietly until their prey is close enough for a quick grab. Others are patient foragers, moving slowly through\ntheir environment to detect possible prey. Lizard tongues are long and sticky and can be extended at high speed for capturing\ninsects or other small prey. Traditionally, the only venomous lizards are the Gila monster and the beaded lizard. However,\nvenom glands have also been identified in several species of monitors and iguanids, but the venom is not injected directly and\nshould probably be regarded as a toxin delivered with the bite.\nSpecialized features of the jaw are related to adaptations for feeding that have evolved to feed on relatively large prey (even\nthough some current species have reversed this trend). Snakes are thought to have descended from either burrowing or aquatic\nlizards over 100 million years ago (Figure 29.30). They include about 3,600 species, ranging in size from 10 centimeter-long\nthread snakes to 10 meter-long pythons and anacondas. All snakes are legless, except for boids (e.g., boa constrictors), which\nhave vestigial hindlimbs in the form ofpelvic spurs. Like caecilian amphibians, the narrow bodies of most snakes have only a\nsingle functional lung. All snakes are carnivorous and eat small animals, birds, eggs, fish, and insects.\n\n--- Page 824 ---\n804",

Abundant research has shown\nthat birds are really an extant clade that evolved from maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs about 150 million years ago. Thus, even\nthough the most obvious characteristic thatseemsto set birds apart from other extant vertebrates is the presence of feathers,\nwe now know that feathers probably appeared in the common ancestor of both ornithischian and saurischian lineages of\ndinosaurs. Feathers in these clades are also homologous to reptilian scales and mammalian hair, according to the most recent\nresearch. While the wings of vertebrates like bats function without feathers, birds rely on feathers, and wings, along with other\nmodifications of body structure and physiology, for flight, as we shall see.\nCharacteristics of Birds\nBirds are endothermic, and more specifically,homeothermic\u2014meaning that they usually maintain an elevated and constant\nbody temperature, which is significantly above the average body temperature of most mammals. This is, in part, due to the fact\nthat active flight\u2014especially the hovering skills of birds such as hummingbirds\u2014requires enormous amounts of energy, which\nin turn necessitates a high metabolic rate. Like mammals (which are also endothermic and homeothermic and covered with an\ninsulating pelage), birds have several different types of feathers that together keep \u201cheat\u201d (infrared energy) within the core of the\nbody, away from the surface where it can be lost by radiation and convection to the environment.\nModern birds produce two main types of feathers:contour feathersanddown feathers.Contour feathershave a number of\nparallelbarbsthat branch from acentral shaft. The barbs in turn have microscopic branches calledbarbulesthat are linked\ntogether by minute hooks, making the vane of a feather a strong, flexible, and uninterrupted surface. In contrast, the barbules\nofdown feathersdo not interlock, making these feathers especially good for insulation, trapping air in spaces between the\nloose, interlocking barbules of adjacent feathers to decrease the rate of heat loss by convection and radiation. Certain parts of a\nbird\u2019s body are covered in down feathers, and the base of other feathers has a downy portion, whereas newly hatched birds are\ncovered almost entirely in down, which serves as an excellent coat of insulation, increasing thethermal boundary layerbetween\nthe skin and the outside environment.\nFeathers not only provide insulation, but also allow for flight, producing the lift and thrust necessary for flying birds to become\nand stay airborne. The feathers on a wing areflexible,so the feathers at the end of the wing separate as air moves over them,\nreducing the drag on the wing. Flight feathers are also asymmetrical and curved, so that air flowing over them generates lift.\nTwo types of flight feathers are found on the wings,primary feathersandsecondary feathers(Figure 29.32).Primary feathers\nare located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust as the bird moves its wings downward, using the pectoralis major muscles.\n\n--- Page 826 ---\n806",

Many birds have hollow, pneumatic bones, which make flight easier.\nOther modifications that reduce weight include the lack of a urinary bladder. Birds possess acloaca, an external body cavity into\nwhich the intestinal, urinary, and genital orifices empty in reptiles, birds, and the monotreme mammals. The cloaca allows\nwater to be reabsorbed from waste back into the bloodstream. Thus, uric acid isnoteliminated as a liquid but is concentrated\nintourate salts, which are expelled along with fecal matter. In this way, water is not held in a urinary bladder, which would\nincrease body weight. In addition, the females of most bird species only possess one functional (left) ovary rather than two,\nfurther reducing body mass.\nThe respiratory system of birds is dramatically different from that of reptiles and mammals, and is well adapted for the high\nmetabolic rate required for flight. To begin, the air spaces of pneumatic bone are sometimes connected toair sacsin the body\ncavity, which replace coelomic fluid and also lighten the body. These air sacs are also connected to the path of airflow through\nthe bird's body, and function in respiration. Unlike mammalian lungs in which air flows in two directions, as it is breathed in\nand out, diluting the concentration of oxygen, airflow through bird lungs is unidirectional (Figure 29.34). Gas exchange occurs\nin \"air capillaries\" or microscopic air passages within the lungs. The arrangement of air capillaries in the lungs creates a counter-\ncurrent exchange system with the pulmonary blood. In a counter-current system, the air flows in one direction and the blood\nflows in the opposite direction, producing a favorable diffusion gradient and creating an efficient means of gas exchange. This\nvery effective oxygen-delivery system of birds supports their higher metabolic activity. In effect, ventilation is provided by the\nparabronchi(minimally expandible lungs) with thin air sacs located among the visceral organs and the skeleton. Asyrinx(voice\nbox) resides near the junction of the trachea and bronchi. The syrinx, however, isnothomologous to the mammalian larynx,\nwhich resides within the upper part of the trachea.\nFigure29.34Air flow in bird lungs. Avian respiration is an efficient system of gas exchange with air flowingunidirectionally. A full ventilation\ncycle takes two breathing cycles. During the first inhalation, air passes from the trachea into posterior air sacs, then during the first\nexhalation into the lungs. The second inhalation moves the air in the lungs to the anterior air sacs, and the second exhalation moves the air\nin the anterior air sacs out of the body. Overall, each inhalation moves air into the air sacs, while each exhalation moves fresh air through\nthe lungs and \"used\" air out of the body. The air sacs are connected to the hollow interior of bones. (credit: modification of work by L.\nShyamal)\nBeyond the unique characteristics discussed above, birds are also unusual vertebrates because of a number of other features.\nFirst, they typically have an elongate (very \u201cdinosaurian\u201d) S-shaped neck, but a short tail orpygostyle, produced from the fusion\nof the caudal vertebrae. Unlike mammals, birds have only one occipital condyle, allowing them extensive movement of the head\nand neck. They also have a very thin epidermis without sweat glands, and a specializeduropygial glandor sebaceous \u201cpreening\ngland\u201d found at the dorsal base of the tail. This gland is an essential topreening(a virtually continuous activity) in most birds\nbecause it produces an oily substance that birds use to help waterproof their feathers as well as keep them flexible for flight.

                "text": "\u2022 Birds 809\nThe Evolution of Flight in Birds\nThere are two basic hypotheses that explain how flight may have evolved in birds: thearboreal (\u201ctree\u201d) hypothesisand the\nterrestrial (\u201cland\u201d) hypothesis. Thearboreal hypothesisposits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from\nbranch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight. In contrast to this, the\nterrestrial hypothesisholds that running (perhaps pursuing active prey such as small cursorial animals) was the stimulus for\nflight. In this scenario, wings could be used to capture prey and were preadapted for balance and flapping flight. Ostriches,\nwhich are large flightless birds, hold their wings out when they run, possibly for balance. However, this condition may represent\na behavioral relict of the clade of flying birds that were their ancestors. It seems more likely that small feathered arboreal\ndinosaurs, were capable of gliding (and flapping) from tree to tree and branch to branch, improving the chances of escaping\nenemies, finding mates, and obtaining prey such as flying insects. This early flight behavior would have also greatly increased\nthe opportunity for species dispersal.\nAlthough we have a good understanding of how feathers and flight may have evolved, the question of how endothermy evolved\nin birds (and other lineages) remains unanswered. Feathers provide insulation, but this is only beneficial forthermoregulatory\npurposesif body heat is being produced internally. Similarly, internal heat production is only viable for the evolution of\nendothermy ifinsulation is presentto retain that infrared energy. It has been suggested that one or the other\u2014feathers or\nendothermy\u2014evolved first in response to some other selective pressure (e.g., the ability to be active at night, provide\ncamouflage, repel water, or serve as signals for mate selection). It seems probable that feathers and endothermy coevolved\ntogether, the improvement and evolutionary advancement of feathers reinforcing the evolutionary advancement of endothermy,\nand so on.\nDuring the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 MYA), a group known as the Enantiornithes was the dominant bird type (Figure 29.36).\nEnantiornithes means \u201copposite birds,\u201d which refers to the fact that certain bones of the shoulder are joined differently than the\nway the bones are joined in modern birds. LikeArchaeopteryx, these birds retained teeth in their jaws, but did have a shortened\ntail, and at least some fossils have preserved \u201cfans\u201d of tail feathers. These birds formed an evolutionary lineage separate from\nthat of modern birds, and they did not survive past the Cretaceous. Along with the Enantiornithes, however, another group of\nbirds\u2014the Ornithurae (\"bird tails\"), with a short, fused tail orpygostyle\u2014emerged from the evolutionary line that includes\nmodern birds. This clade was also present in the Cretaceous.\nAfter the extinction of Enantiornithes, theOrnithuraebecame the dominant birds, with a large and rapid radiation occurring\nafter the extinction of the dinosaurs during the Cenozoic era (66 MYA to the present). Molecular analysis based on very large\ndata sets has produced our current understanding of the relationships among living birds. There are three major clades: the\nPaleognathae, the Galloanserae, and the Neoaves. The Paleognathae (\u201cold jaw\u201d) or ratites (polyphyletic) are a group of flightless\nbirds including ostriches, emus, rheas, and kiwis. The Galloanserae include pheasants, ducks, geese and swans. The Neoaves\n(\"new birds\") includes all other birds. The Neoaves themselves have been distributed among five clades:3Strisores (nightjars,\nswifts, and hummingbirds), Columbaves (turacos, bustards, cuckoos, pigeons, and doves), Gruiformes (cranes),\nAequorlitornithes (diving birds, wading birds, and shorebirds), and Inopinaves (a very large clade of land birds including hawks,\nowls, woodpeckers, parrots, falcons, crows, and songbirds).

Although it is not\nvery extensive or obvious on some species (such as whales), hair has many important functions for most mammals. Mammals\nare endothermic, and hair traps a boundary layer of air close to the body, retaining heat generated by metabolic activity. Along\nwith insulation, hair can serve as a sensory mechanism via specialized hairs calledvibrissae, better known as whiskers.\nVibrissae attach to nerves that transmit information about tactile vibration produced by sound sensation, which is particularly\nuseful to nocturnal or burrowing mammals. Hair can also provide protective coloration or be part of social signaling, such as\nwhen an animal\u2019s hair stands \u201con end\u201d to warn enemies, or possibly to make the mammal \u201clook bigger\u201d to predators.\nUnlike the skin of birds, the integument (skin) of mammals, includes a number of different types of secretory glands.Sebaceous\nglandsproduce a lipid mixture calledsebumthat is secreted onto the hair and skin, providing water resistance and lubrication\nfor hair. Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body.Eccrine glandsproduce sweat, or perspiration, which is mainly\ncomposed of water, but also contains metabolic waste products, and sometimes compounds with antibiotic activity. In most\nmammals, eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body, and some mammals do not possess them at all. However, in\nprimates, especially humans, sweat glands are located over most of the body surface and figure prominently in regulating the\nbody temperature through evaporative cooling.Apocrine glands, orscent glands, secrete substances that are used for chemical\ncommunication, such as in skunks.Mammary glandsproduce milk that is used to feed newborns. In both monotremes and\neutherians, both males and females possess mammary glands, while in marsupials, mammary glands have been found only in\nsome opossums. Mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or eccrine glands, but their evolutionary origin is not entirely\nclear.\nThe skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features. The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone, the\ndentary, and the jaw hinge connects the dentary to the squamosal (flat) part of the temporal bone in the skull. The jaws of other\nvertebrates are composed of several bones, including the quadrate bone at the back of the skull and the articular bone at the\nback of the jaw, with the jaw connected between the quadrate and articular bones. In the ear of other vertebrates, vibrations are\ntransmitted to the inner ear by a single bone, thestapes. In mammals, the quadrate and articular bones have moved into the\nmiddle ear (Figure 29.37). The malleus is derived from the articular bone, whereas the incus originated from the quadrate bone.\nThis arrangement of jaw and ear bones aids in distinguishing fossil mammals from fossils of other synapsids.\nFigure29.37Mammalian ear bones. Bones of the mammalian middle ear are modified from bones of the jaw and skull in reptiles. The\nstapes is found in other vertebrates (e.g., the columella of birds) whereas in mammals, the malleus and incus are derived from the articular\nand quadrate bones, respectively. (credit: NCI)\nThe adductor muscles that close the jaw comprise two major muscles in mammals: thetemporalisand themasseter. Working\ntogether, these muscles permit up-and-down and side-to-side movements of the jaw, making chewing possible\u2014which is\nunique to mammals. Most mammals haveheterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth\n(incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) rather than just one type and shape of tooth. Most mammals are alsodiphyodonts,\nmeaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or \u201cbaby\u201d teeth, and permanent teeth. Most other\nvertebrates with teeth arepolyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life.\nMammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart; however, the hearts of birds and mammals are an example of convergent\n\n--- Page 832 ---\n812",

One group of transitional mammals was themorganucodonts, small nocturnal insectivores.\nThe jaws of morganucodonts were \u201ctransitional,\u201d with features of both reptilian and mammalian jaws (Figure 29.39). Like\nmodern mammals, the morganucodonts had differentiated teeth and were diphyodonts. Mammals first began to diversify in the\nMesozoic era, from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods.

The eutherians and the marsupials together comprise a clade of therian mammals, with the monotremes forming a\nsister clade to both metatherians and eutherians.\nThere are very few living species ofmonotremes: the platypus and four species of echidnas, or spiny anteaters. The leathery-\nbeaked platypus belongs to the familyOrnithorhynchidae(\u201cbird beak\u201d), whereas echidnas belong to the familyTachyglossidae\n(\u201csticky tongue\u201d) (Figure 29.40). The platypus and one species of echidna are found in Australia, and the other species of echidna\nare found in New Guinea. Monotremes are unique among mammals because they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to live\nyoung. The shells of their eggs are not like the hard shells of birds, but have a leathery shell, similar to the shells of reptile eggs.\nMonotremes retain their eggs through about two-thirds of the developmental period, and then lay them in nests. A yolk-sac\nplacenta helps support development. The babies hatch in a fetal state and complete their development in the nest, nourished by\nmilk secreted by mammary glands opening directly to the skin. Monotremes, except for young platypuses, do not have teeth.\nBody temperature in the three monotreme species is maintained at about 30\u00b0C, considerably lower than the average body\ntemperature of marsupial and placental mammals, which are typically between 35 and 38\u00b0C.\n\n--- Page 834 ---\n814",

They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1\nounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular\ninterest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species.\nCharacteristics of Primates\nAll primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. This arboreal heritage of\nprimates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for climbing, or brachiation (swinging through trees using the arms).\nThese adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other\ntoes (except humans) and thumbs sufficiently separated from fingers to allow for gripping branches, and 3)stereoscopic vision,\ntwo overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. Other\ncharacteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into\nflattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.\nOrder Primates is divided into two groups: Strepsirrhini (\u201cturned-nosed\u201d) and Haplorhini (\u201csimple-nosed\u201d) primates.\nStrepsirrhines, also called the wet-nosed primates, include prosimians like the bush babies and pottos of Africa, the lemurs of\nMadagascar, and the lorises of Southeast Asia. Haplorhines, or dry-nosed primates, include tarsiers (Figure 29.42) and simians\n(New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). In general, strepsirrhines tend to be nocturnal, have larger\nolfactory centers in the brain, and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids. Haplorhines, with a few\nexceptions, are diurnal, and depend more on their vision. Another interesting difference between the strepsirrhines and\nhaplorhines is that strepsirrhines have the enzymes for making vitamin C, while haplorhines have to get it from their food.\nFigure29.42A Philippine tarsier. This tarsier,Carlito syrichta, is one of the smallest primates\u2014about 5 inches long, from nose to the base of\nthe tail. The tail is not shown, but is about twice the length of the body. Note the large eyes, each of which is about the same size as the\nanimal's brain, and the long hind legs.

They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size\nand appearance. The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented. These proto-primates remain\nlargely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. Although genetic evidence suggests that primates\ndiverged from other mammals about 85 MYA, the oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record date\nto about 65 MYA. Fossils like the proto-primatePlesiadapis(although some researchers do not agree thatPlesiadapiswas a\nproto-primate) had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. They were found in North America\nand Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.\nThe first true primates date to about 55 MYA in the Eocene epoch. They were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.\nThese early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs.

Two species of orangutan are native to different islands in Indonesia: Borneo (P. pygmaeus) and\nSumatra (P. abelii). A third orangutan species,Pongo tapanuliensis, was reported in 2017 from the Batang Toru forest in\nSumatra. Orangutans are arboreal and solitary. Males are much larger than females and have cheek and throat pouches when\nmature. Gorillas all live in Central Africa. The eastern and western populations are recognized as separate species,G. berengei\nandG. gorilla. Gorillas are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males about twice the size of females. In older males, called\nsilverbacks, the hair on the back turns white or gray. Chimpanzees (Figure 29.45b) are the species considered to be most closely\nrelated to humans. However, the species most closely related to the chimpanzee is the bonobo. Genetic evidence suggests that\nchimpanzee and human lineages separated 5 to 7 MYA, while chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus) lineages\nseparated about 2 MYA. Chimpanzees and bonobos both live in Central Africa, but the two species are separated by the Congo\nRiver, a significant geographic barrier. Bonobos are slighter than chimpanzees, but have longer legs and more hair on their\nheads. In chimpanzees, white tail tufts identify juveniles, while bonobos keep their white tail tufts for life. Bonobos also have\nhigher-pitched voices than chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are more aggressive and sometimes kill animals from other groups,\nwhile bonobos are not known to do so. Both chimpanzees and bonobos are omnivorous. Orangutan and gorilla diets also include\nfoods from multiple sources, although the predominant food items are fruits for orangutans and foliage for gorillas.\nFigure29.45Lesser and great apes. This white-cheeked gibbon (a) is a lesser ape. In gibbons of this species, females and infants are buff\nand males are black. This young chimpanzee (b) is one of the great apes. It possesses a relatively large brain and has no tail. (credit a: MAC.\ncredit b: modification of work by Aaron Logan)\nHuman Evolution\nThe family Hominidae of order Primates includes the hominoids: the great apes and humans (Figure 29.46). Evidence from the\nfossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a\ncommon hominoid ancestor approximately six million years ago. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that\nincludes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. The term hominin is used to refer to those species that\nevolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to\nchimpanzees. A number of marker features differentiate humans from the other hominoids, including bipedalism or upright\nposture, increase in the size of the brain, and a fully opposable thumb that can touch the little finger. Bipedal hominins include\nseveral groups that were probably part of the modern human lineage\u2014Australopithecus,Homo habilis, andHomo\nerectus\u2014and several non-ancestral groups that can be considered \u201ccousins\u201d of modern humans, such as Neanderthals and\nDenisovans.\nDetermining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been\nrecovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of\nevolution from early hominins to modern humans. In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it\nis clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named)\nrepresent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.\n\n--- Page 838 ---\n818",

When the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot stems are\narranged in a ring. In plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together and produce the\ncharacteristic growth rings. In monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the ground tissue\n(Figure 30.9).\nFigure30.9In (a) dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue. The xylem tissue is located toward\nthe interior of the vascular bundle, and phloem is located toward the exterior. Sclerenchyma fibers cap the vascular bundles. In (b) monocot\nstems, vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are scattered throughout the ground tissue.\nXylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements. The latter two types conduct water and\nare dead at maturity.Tracheidsare xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified. Water moves from one tracheid\nto another through regions on the side walls known as pits, where secondary walls are absent.Vessel elementsare xylem cells\nwith thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids. Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate\nat the end walls of the element. Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant.\n\n--- Page 856 ---\n836",

If the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start forming lateral branches.\nGardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus encouraging the axillary buds\nto grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisBBC Nature video(http://openstax.org/l/motion_plants)showing how time-lapse photography captures plant\ngrowth at high speed.\nSecondary Growth\nThe increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are\nlacking in herbaceous plants. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see\nFigure 30.10). The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem. The\ncells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and secondary\nphloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due\nto the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of cork cambium, which\nforms the tough outermost layer of the stem. The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which provides hardiness and\nstrength.\nIn woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance\nknown as suberin that can repel water. The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss. The\ncork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. The cork cambium,\ncork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed theperiderm. The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants. In\nsome plants, the periderm has many openings, known aslenticels, which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the\noutside atmosphere (Figure 30.11). This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex, xylem, and\nphloem.\nFigure30.11Lenticels on the bark of this cherry tree enable the woody stem to exchange gases with the surrounding atmosphere. (credit:\nRoger Griffith)\nAnnual Rings\nThe activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. During the spring growing season, cells of the secondary\nxylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. This is known as early wood, or\nspring wood. During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late wood, or autumn wood,\nwhich is denser than early wood. This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of\n\n--- Page 858 ---\n838",

Some leaves are attached to the\nplant stem by apetiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are calledsessileleaves.\nSmall green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known asstipules. Most leaves have a midrib, which travels\nthe length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is called the margin.\nFigure 30.21shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.\nFigure30.21Deceptively simple in appearance, a leaf is a highly efficient structure.\nWithin each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called thevenationpattern. Monocots and\ndicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 30.22). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across\nthe length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming\na pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, theGinkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork.\nFigure30.22(a) Tulip (Tulipa), a monocot, has leaves with parallel venation.

A waxy layer known as thecuticlecovers the\nleaves of all plant species. The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have small hairs\n(trichomes) on the leaf surface. Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing toxic or bad-\ntasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface (Figure 30.25).\nFigure30.25Trichomes give leaves a fuzzy appearance as in this (a) sundew (Droserasp.).

Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape. These are the cells of the\nspongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange\nbetween the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. In aquatic plants, the intercellular spaces in the spongy\nparenchyma help the leaf float. Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts.

These needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid in\nreducing water loss. In hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination with their\nsucculent stems, help to conserve water.

Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to thrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or\nmore of these resources is in short supply.\nIn tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much of the sunlight from\nreaching the forest floor. Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to maximize the capture of sunlight. Other\nspecies are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve as a physical support. Such plants are able to grow high up in\nthe canopy atop the branches of other trees, where sunlight is more plentiful. Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in\nthe branches and leaves of the supporting plant. Bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples\nof tropical epiphytes (Figure 30.28). Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently capture and store\nwater.\n\n--- Page 868 ---\n848",

The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the cells evaporates\ninto the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells. This decrease creates a greater tension on the\nwater in the mesophyll cells (Figure 30.34), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem vessels. The xylem vessels and\ntracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure. Rings in the vessels maintain their tubular shape,\nmuch like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure.

These adaptations impede air flow across\nthe stomatal pore and reduce transpiration. Multiple epidermal layers are also commonly found in these types of plants.\nTransportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem\nPlants need an energy source to grow. In seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by\nmetabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants. Once green shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to\nproduce their own food by photosynthesizing. The products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually in\nthe form of simple sugars such as sucrose.\nStructures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to assources. Sugars produced in sources, such as\nleaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process calledtranslocation. The points of sugar\ndelivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are calledsinks. Seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a source or a\nsink, depending on the plant\u2019s stage of development and the season.\nThe products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem. For example, the highest leaves\nwill send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward to the\nroots. Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the flow in the xylem, which is always unidirectional (soil\nto leaf to atmosphere). The pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops. Photosynthates are directed\nprimarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and fruits during reproductive\ndevelopment. They are also directed to tubers for storage.\nTranslocation: Transport from Source to Sink\nPhotosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves. From there they are\ntranslocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored. Mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels called\nplasmodesmata. Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (STEs) in the vascular\nbundles. From the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem STEs. The sucrose is actively transported\nagainst its concentration gradient (a process requiring ATP) into the phloem cells using the electrochemical potential of the\nproton gradient. This is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-H+symporter.\nPhloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressure-driven\nbulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap. Companion cells are associated with STEs. They assist with metabolic activities and\nproduce energy for the STEs (Figure 30.36).\nFigure30.36Phloem is comprised of cells called sieve-tube elements.

The response of\nplants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light-absorbing\npigment called achromophore. Together, the two are called a chromoprotein.\nThe red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants. Sensory\nphotoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available in\nthe daylight spectrum. In terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the spectrum.\nAs light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the far-red end,\nshifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light. Blue-light receptors allow plants to\ngauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in blue\u2013green emissions. Water absorbs red light, which makes\nthe detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants.\nThe Phytochrome System and the Red/Far-Red Response\nThephytochromesare a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole\nlight-absorbing head group of chlorophyll. Phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: Pr and Pfr. Pr absorbs red\nlight (~667nm) and is immediately converted to Pfr. Pfr absorbs far-red light (~730nm) and is quickly converted back to Pr.\nAbsorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation and\nactivity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound. Pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore, exposure\nto red light yields physiological activity. Exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity. Together, the two forms\nrepresent the phytochrome system (Figure 30.38).\nThe phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch. It monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of environmental\nlight. The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts the chromoprotein\nto the inactive Pr form. Additionally, Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark, or break down over time. In all instances, the\nphysiological response induced by red light is reversed. The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) can directly activate other\nmolecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses specific gene\nexpression.\nOnce the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs. Unfiltered, full sunlight contains much\nmore red light than far-red light. Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in the\nfar-red region, any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched light.\nThe preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the Pr (inactive) form, slowing growth. The\nnearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these areas sense the\nred light, which activates the Pfr form and induces growth. In short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system to grow away\nfrom shade and towards light. Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the evolutionary\nadvantages of the phytochrome system are obvious.\nIn seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded). Instead, is it\nused merely to determine if there is any light at all. This is especially important in species with very small seeds, such as lettuce.\nBecause of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves. Their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run out of fuel. If\nthey germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight and would die. In\nthe dark, phytochrome is in the Pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate if exposed to light at\nthe surface of the soil. Upon exposure to light, Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds.\n\n--- Page 878 ---\n858",

Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source (Figure 30.39), while negative phototropism (also called\nskototropism) is growth away from light.\nThe aptly-namedphototropinsare protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response. Like all plant\nphotoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore. In\nphototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins called\nflavoproteins.\nOther responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of\nstomata. However, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best\nunderstood.\nIn their 1880 treatiseThe Power of Movements in Plants, Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described phototropism as the\nbending of seedlings toward light. Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem), but\nthat the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant. They concluded that the signal had to travel from the\napical meristem to the base of the plant.\nFigure30.39Azure bluets (Houstonia caerulea) display a phototropic response by bending toward the light. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nIn 1913, Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending at\nthe base. He cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip. The seedling\nbent toward the light when illuminated. However, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and the cut\nbase, the seedling did not bend. A refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side of the\nseedling. When the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light. Therefore, the\nchemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded side than\non the illuminated side. We now know that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates phototropin\nactivation across the stem. Most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid (IAA) to\naccumulate on the shaded side. Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.\nCryptochromesare another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.\nCryptochromes set the plants' 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues. There is some\nevidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse the navigation menu in the left panel of thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/plnts_n_motion)to view images of plants in\n\n--- Page 880 ---\n860",

GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves, and seed embryos. In\nurban areas, GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and reduce the frequency of\npruning.\nGAs break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or light to\ngerminate. Abscisic acid is a strong antagonist of GA action. Other effects of GAs include gender expression, seedless fruit\ndevelopment, and the delay of senescence in leaves and fruit. Seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods\nand contain inconspicuous seeds that fail to develop. Because GAs are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development\nand stem elongation are under GA control, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters.\nMaturing grapes are routinely treated with GA to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which\nreduces the instance of mildew infection (Figure 30.40).\nFigure30.40In grapes, application of gibberellic acid increases the size of fruit and loosens clustering. (credit: Bob Nichols, USDA)\nAbscisic Acid\nThe plant hormoneabscisic acid(ABA) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls.\nHowever, more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process. ABA accumulates as a\nresponse to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths. Its activity\ncounters many of the growth-promoting effects of GAs and auxins. ABA inhibits stem elongation and induces dormancy in\nlateral buds.\nABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins. Plants adapted to\ntemperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate. This mechanism protects young plants\nfrom sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter. As the hormone gradually breaks down over winter, the\nseed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring. Another effect of ABA is to promote\nthe development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud. Low soil moisture\ncauses an increase in ABA, which causes stomata to close, reducing water loss in winter buds.\n\n--- Page 882 ---\n862",

Herbivores both large and small use plants as food, and actively\nchew them. Pathogens are agents of disease. These infectious microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes, live off\nof the plant and damage its tissues. Plants have developed a variety of strategies to discourage or kill attackers.\nThe first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier. Bark and the waxy cuticle can protect against predators.\nOther adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified leaves. They\ndiscourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions. A plant\u2019s exterior protection can be\ncompromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens. If the first line of defense is breached,\nthe plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes.\nSecondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration or\nplant growth and development. Many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them. Some\nmetabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or repellent\ntastes (like the bitterness of quinine). Other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation (caffeine is one\nexample) or the lethargy associated with opioids. Some compounds become toxic after ingestion. For instance, glycol cyanide in\nthe cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion; the nearly 500 million humans who rely on cassava for nutrition must be\ncertain to process the root properly before eating.\nMechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at sites\nfarther from the injury location. Some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours. The infected and\nsurrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection.\nLong-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator. As tissue is damaged, jasmonates may\npromote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators. Jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds that\nattract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their host.\nThe plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair.\n\n--- Page 884 ---\n864",

Nutrients that plants require in\nlarger amounts are calledmacronutrients. About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients: carbon,\nhydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. The first of these macronutrients, carbon\n(C), is required to form carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other compounds; it is therefore present in all\nmacromolecules. On average, the dry weight (excluding water) of a cell is 50 percent carbon. As shown inFigure 31.3, carbon is a\nkey part of plant biomolecules.\nFigure31.3Cellulose, the main structural component of the plant cell wall, makes up over thirty percent of plant matter. It is the most\nabundant organic compound on earth.\nThe next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen (N); it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. Nitrogen is also used in the\nsynthesis of some vitamins. Hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many organic compounds, and also form\nwater. Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration; plants use oxygen to store energy in the form of ATP. Phosphorus (P), another\nmacromolecule, is necessary to synthesize nucleic acids and phospholipids. As part of ATP, phosphorus enables food energy to\nbe converted into chemical energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, light energy is converted into chemical energy\nduring photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration.Sulfur is part of\n\n--- Page 894 ---\n874",

Soil\nquality depends not only on the chemical composition of the soil, but also the topography (regional surface features) and the\npresence of living organisms. In agriculture, the history of the soil, such as the cultivating practices and previous crops, modify\nthe characteristics and fertility of that soil.\nSoil develops very slowly over long periods of time, and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on\nmineral, rock, and organic compounds.

                "text": "\u2022 The Soil 877\nSoil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers; together, the vertical section of a\nsoil is called thesoil profile. Within the soil profile, soil scientists define zones called horizons. Ahorizonis a soil layer with\ndistinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers. Five factors account for soil formation: parent\nmaterial, climate, topography, biological factors, and time.\nParent Material\nThe organic and inorganic material in which soils form is theparent material. Mineral soils form directly from the weathering\nofbedrock, the solid rock that lies beneath the soil, and therefore, they have a similar composition to the original rock. Other\nsoils form in materials that came from elsewhere, such as sand and glacial drift. Materials located in the depth of the soil are\nrelatively unchanged compared with the deposited material. Sediments in rivers may have different characteristics, depending\non whether the stream moves quickly or slowly. A fast-moving river could have sediments of rocks and sand, whereas a slow-\nmoving river could have fine-textured material, such as clay.\nClimate\nTemperature, moisture, and wind cause different patterns of weathering and therefore affect soil characteristics. The presence\nof moisture and nutrients from weathering will also promote biological activity: a key component of a quality soil.\nTopography\nRegional surface features (familiarly called \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d) can have a major influence on the characteristics and fertility of\na soil. Topography affects water runoff, which strips away parent material and affects plant growth. Steeps soils are more prone\nto erosion and may be thinner than soils that are relatively flat or level.\nBiological factors\nThe presence of living organisms greatly affects soil formation and structure. Animals and microorganisms can produce pores\nand crevices, and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation. Plant secretions promote the\ndevelopment of microorganisms around the root, in an area known as therhizosphere. Additionally, leaves and other material\nthat fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition.\nTime\nTime is an important factor in soil formation because soils develop over long periods. Soil formation is a dynamic process.\nMaterials are deposited over time, decompose, and transform into other materials that can be used by living organisms or\ndeposited onto the surface of the soil.\nPhysical Properties of the Soil\nSoils are named and classified based on their horizons. The soil profile has four distinct layers: 1) O horizon; 2) A horizon; 3) B\nhorizon, or subsoil; and 4) C horizon, or soil base (Figure 31.7). TheO horizonhas freshly decomposing organic\nmatter\u2014humus\u2014at its surface, with decomposed vegetation at its base. Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances\nsoil moisture retention. Topsoil\u2014the top layer of soil\u2014is usually two to three inches deep, but this depth can vary considerably.\nFor instance, river deltas like the Mississippi River delta have deep layers of topsoil. Topsoil is rich in organic material; microbial\nprocesses occur there, and it is the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of plant production. TheA horizonconsists of a mixture of organic material\nwith inorganic products of weathering, and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil. This horizon is typically darkly\ncolored because of the presence of organic matter. In this area, rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from\nthe surface. TheBhorizonis an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward, resulting in a dense layer in the\nsoil. In some soils, the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate. TheC horizon, or soil base, includes the\nparent material, plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil. The parent material may be either\ncreated in its natural place, or transported from elsewhere to its present location. Beneath the C horizon lies bedrock.\n\n--- Page 898 ---\n878",

These conditions are very common; therefore, most plants rely on fungi to facilitate the uptake of minerals\nfrom the soil. Fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant roots, in which the fungi actually are integrated\ninto the physical structure of the root. The fungi colonize the living root tissue during active plant growth.\nThrough mycorrhization, the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals, such as zinc and copper, from the soil. The\nfungus obtains nutrients, such as sugars, from the plant root (Figure 31.12). Mycorrhizae help increase the surface area of the\nplant root system because hyphae, which are narrow, can spread beyond the nutrient depletion zone. Hyphae can grow into\nsmall soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would otherwise be unavailable to the plant. The beneficial effect on the\nplant is best observed in poor soils. The benefit to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by\nplants. Mycorrhizae functions as a physical barrier to pathogens. It also provides an induction of generalized host defense\nmechanisms, and sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi.\nFigure31.12Root tips proliferate in the presence of mycorrhizal infection, which appears as off-white fuzz in this image. (credit:\nmodification of work by Nilsson et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2005)\nThere are two types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath\naround the roots, called a mantle. Hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil, which increases the surface area\nfor water and mineral absorption. This type of mycorrhizae is found in forest trees, especially conifers, birches, and oaks.\nEndomycorrhizae, also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, do not form a dense sheath over the root. Instead, the fungal mycelium is\nembedded within the root tissue. Endomycorrhizae are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants.\n\n--- Page 902 ---\n882",

First, in\nthe process ofmegasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploidmegasporangium\u2014an area of tissue in the ovules\u2014undergoes\nmeiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase,megagametogenesis, the surviving\nhaploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the\nmegagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei\u2014thepolar nuclei\u2014move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid\ncentral cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the\nend of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into theantipodalcells, which later degenerate. The nucleus closest to\nthe micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop intosynergidcells (Figure 32.8). The\nsynergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. Once fertilization is complete, the\nresulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed.\n\n--- Page 916 ---\n896",

In gymnosperms, pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone. Upon transfer, the\npollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm for fertilizing the egg. Pollination has been well studied since the time\nof Gregor Mendel. Mendel successfully carried out self- as well as cross-pollination in garden peas while studying how\ncharacteristics were passed on from one generation to the next. Today\u2019s crops are a result of plant breeding, which employs\nartificial selection to produce the present-day cultivars. A case in point is today's corn, which is a result of years of breeding that\nstarted with its ancestor, teosinte. The teosinte that the ancient Mayans originally began cultivating had tiny seeds\u2014vastly\ndifferent from today\u2019s relatively giant ears of corn. Interestingly, though these two plants appear to be entirely different, the\ngenetic difference between them is miniscule.\nPollination takes two forms: self-pollination and cross-pollination.Self-pollinationoccurs when the pollen from the anther is\ndeposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.Cross-pollinationis the transfer of pollen from\nthe anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination occurs in\nflowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower\u2019s\nstigma. This method of pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for\npollinators.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore thisinteractive website(http://openstax.org/l/pollination)to review self-pollination and cross-pollination.\n\n--- Page 920 ---\n900",

(credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nMany flies are attracted to flowers that have a decaying smell or an odor of rotting flesh. These flowers, which produce nectar,\nusually have dull colors, such as brown or purple. They are found on the corpse flower or voodoo lily (Amorphophallus), dragon\narum (Dracunculus), and carrion flower (Stapleia,Rafflesia). The nectar provides energy, whereas the pollen provides protein.\nWasps are also important insect pollinators, and pollinate many species of figs.\nButterflies, such as the monarch, pollinate many garden flowers and wildflowers, which usually occur in clusters. These flowers\nare brightly colored, have a strong fragrance, are open during the day, and have nectar guides to make access to nectar easier.\nThe pollen is picked up and carried on the butterfly\u2019s limbs. Moths, on the other hand, pollinate flowers during the late\nafternoon and night. The flowers pollinated by moths are pale or white and are flat, enabling the moths to land. One well-\nstudied example of a moth-pollinated plant is the yucca plant, which is pollinated by the yucca moth. The shape of the flower\nand moth have adapted in such a way as to allow successful pollination. The moth deposits pollen on the sticky stigma for\nfertilization to occur later. The female moth also deposits eggs into the ovary. As the eggs develop into larvae, they obtain food\nfrom the flower and developing seeds. Thus, both the insect and flower benefit from each other in this symbiotic relationship.\nThe corn earworm moth and Gaura plant have a similar relationship (Figure 32.13).\nFigure32.13A corn earworm sips nectar from a night-blooming Gaura plant.

This is called a double fertilization.\nAfter fertilization, the zygote divides to form two cells: the upper cell, or terminal cell, and the lower, or basal, cell. The division\nof the basal cell gives rise to thesuspensor, which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue. The suspensor\nprovides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo. The terminal cell also divides,\ngiving rise to a globular-shaped proembryo (Figure 32.19a). In dicots (eudicots), the developing embryo has a heart shape, due to\nthe presence of the two rudimentarycotyledons(Figure 32.19b). In non-endospermic dicots, such asCapsella bursa, the\nendosperm develops initially, but is then digested, and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons. As the embryo and\ncotyledons enlarge, they run out of room inside the developing seed, and are forced to bend (Figure 32.19c). Ultimately, the\nembryo and cotyledons fill the seed (Figure 32.19d), and the seed is ready for dispersal. Embryonic development is suspended\nafter some time, and growth is resumed only when the seed germinates.

Monocots, such as corn (right), have\none cotyledon, called the scutellum; it channels nutrition to the growing embryo. Both monocot and dicot embryos have a plumule that\nforms the leaves, a hypocotyl that forms the stem, and a radicle that forms the root. The embryonic axis comprises everything between the\nplumule and the radicle, not including the cotyledon(s).\nWhat of the following statements is true?\na. Both monocots and dicots have an endosperm.\nb. The radicle develops into the root.\nc. The plumule is part of the epicotyl.\nd. The endosperm is part of the embryo.\nThe storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots. In monocots, such as corn and wheat,\nthe single cotyledon is called ascutellum; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue (xylem and\nphloem). Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm. Upon germination, enzymes are secreted by thealeurone, a single\nlayer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo. The enzymes degrade the stored\ncarbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature\nstrand to the developing embryo. Therefore, the scutellum can be seen to be an absorptive organ, not a storage organ.\nThe two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo. Inendospermic dicots, the food reserves are\nstored in the endosperm. During germination, the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the\nenzymatically released food reserves, much like in monocots (monocots, by definition, also have endospermic seeds). Tobacco\n(Nicotiana tabaccum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum) are examples of endospermic dicots. In\nnon-endospermic dicots, the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization, but the endosperm food\nreserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage. The two halves of a peanut seed (Arachis\nhypogaea) and the split peas (Pisum sativum) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves.\nThe seed, along with the ovule, is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac. In dicots, the\nseed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as thetestaand inner coat known as thetegmen.\nThe embryonic axis consists of three parts: the plumule, the radicle, and the hypocotyl. The portion of the embryo between the\ncotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as thehypocotyl(hypocotyl means \u201cbelow the cotyledons\u201d). The embryonic\naxis terminates in aradicle(the embryonic root), which is the region from which the root will develop. In dicots, the hypocotyls\nextend above ground, giving rise to the stem of the plant. In monocots, the hypocotyl does not show above ground because\nmonocots do not exhibit stem elongation. The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the\nepicotyl. Theplumuleis composed of the epicotyl, young leaves, and the shoot apical meristem.\nUpon germination in dicot seeds, the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards. This shape is called\nthe plumule hook, and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark. Therefore, as the epicotyl pushes through the\ntough and abrasive soil, the plumule is protected from damage.

This method does not require the investment\nrequired to produce a flower, attract pollinators, or find a means of seed dispersal. Asexual reproduction produces plants that\nare genetically identical to the parent plant because no mixing of male and female gametes takes place. Traditionally, these\nplants survive well under stable environmental conditions when compared with plants produced from sexual reproduction\nbecause they carry genes identical to those of their parents.\nMany different types of roots exhibit asexual reproduction (Figure 32.24). The corm is used by gladiolus and garlic. Bulbs, such\nas a scaly bulb in lilies and a tunicate bulb in daffodils, are other common examples. A potato is a stem tuber, while parsnip\npropagates from a taproot.

The exoskeleton is a hard covering or\nshell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land\nanimals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles.\nAs the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin\nand is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. This is fused to the animal\u2019s epidermis. Ingrowths of the\nexoskeleton, calledapodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals (Figure\n33.3). In order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the\noriginal covering. This limits the animal\u2019s ability to grow continually, and may limit the individual\u2019s ability to mature if molting\ndoes not occur at the proper time. The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly to accommodate any increase\nin weight. It is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of eight. The increasing thickness of the\nchitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a relatively small size. The same principles\napply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached on the outside, making it easier to compensate\nfor increased mass.\nFigure33.3Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach. The apodemes on this crab leg are located above\nand below the fulcrum of the claw. Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the claw closed.\nAn animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the other\ntissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement. As the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass increase. The\nspeed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide support and\nmovement.\nLimiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development\nThe exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. All\nliving cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. Diffusion is effective over a\nspecific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an\n\n--- Page 944 ---\n924",

The average\ndaily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal\u2019s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary than most\nanimals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR.\nFor example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in. The\nrelative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short grasses > forbs (any broad-\nleaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals/biennials.\nEnergy Requirements Related to Environment\nAnimals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor.Torporis a process that leads to a decrease in\nactivity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such\nas entering a state ofhibernationduring the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body\ntemperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F), while a bear\u2019s internal\ntemperature is maintained higher at about 37\u00b0 C (99\u00b0 F).\nIf torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is calledestivation. Some desert animals\nuse this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds.\nWhile endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be\nendotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to conserve energy\nduring the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.\nAnimal Body Planes and Cavities\nA standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes. Asagittal planedivides the body into right and left portions. A\nmidsagittal planedivides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves. Afrontal plane(also called a\ncoronal plane) separates the front from the back. Atransverse plane(or, horizontal plane) divides the animal into upper and\nlower portions. This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane.\nFigure 33.5illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged animal) and a human being.\nFigure33.5Shown are the planes of a quadrupedal goat and a bipedal human. The midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in half, into\nright and left portions. The frontal plane divides the front and back, and the transverse plane divides the body into upper and lower\nportions.\nVertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated inFigure 33.6. Two of these are major cavities that\ncontain smaller cavities within them. Thedorsal cavitycontains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities.

Recall that\ntissues are groups of similar cells (cells carrying out related functions). These tissues combine to form organs\u2014like the skin or\nkidney\u2014that have specific, specialized functions within the body. Organs are organized into organ systems to perform\nfunctions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and the digestive system,\nconsisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. Organ systems come together to create an\nentire organism.\nEpithelial Tissues\nEpithelial tissuescover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or\nmultiple layers of cells. The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells.\nEpithelia composed of a single layer of cells is calledsimple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers is called\nstratified epithelia.Table 33.2summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues.\nDifferent Types of Epithelial Tissues\nCell\nDescription Location\nshape\nsimple: lung alveoli, capillaries; stratified: skin,\nsquamous flat, irregular round shape\nmouth, vagina\ncuboidal cube shaped, central nucleus glands, renal tubules\ntall, narrow, nucleus toward base; tall, narrow, simple: digestive tract; pseudostratified: respiratory\ncolumnar\nnucleus along cell tract\ntransitional round, simple but appear stratified urinary bladder\nTable33.2\nSquamous Epithelia\nSquamous epithelialcells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus.

However, each cell is attached to the base membrane\nof the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells, making it\nappear as though there is more than one layer, as seen inFigure 33.10. This is calledpseudostratified, columnar epithelia. This\ncellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells. The cilia enhance the movement of mucus and trapped\nparticles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and harmful material that has\nbeen breathed into the body. Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of the trachea). The goblet cells\ncontain mucus that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from getting into the lungs.\nFigure33.10Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract.

The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a\ncotton ball that has been pulled apart.

Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in\nthe matrix, the tissue bends.\nThere are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth\nand remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live,\nbut in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts are active in breaking\ndown bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are usually found on the\nsurface of the tissue.\nBone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and\nthe surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is organized into\nsubunits calledosteons, as illustrated inFigure 33.15. A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within\nthe Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are\nmicrochannels calledcanaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells. Spongy bone is made of tiny plates\ncalledtrabeculae; these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. Over time, these plates can break causing the\nbone to become less resilient. Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals, providing structure to the animal\nand points of attachment for tendons.\n\n--- Page 954 ---\n934",

The direction is\nmaintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during\nchildbirth, as illustrated inFigure 33.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the\nuterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside,\nmore oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure33.21The birth of a human infant is the result of positive feedback.\nState whether each of the following processes is regulated by a positive feedback loop or a negative feedback loop.\na.

In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of insulation,\nsuch as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air\nbetween their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a\nconstant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in\ncold weather. Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector pili muscles cause \u201cgoose\nbumps,\u201d causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect of increasing body temperature.\nMammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual\u2019s\nability to conserve heat.\nEndotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the\nbody surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow\nin peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. Some animals\nhave adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood returning to\nthe heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other\ninternal organs. This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs. The countercurrent\nadaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. In contrast, similar\nadaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.\nSome ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. For example, a desert ectothermic\nanimal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. The same\nanimals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. Some animals seek water to aid evaporation in cooling\nthem, as seen with reptiles. Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter.\nMany animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. When muscles are contracted, most of the\nenergy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat. Severe cold elicits a shivering reflex that\ngenerates heat for the body. Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in generating heat.\n\n--- Page 962 ---\n942",

Depending on their diet, animals\ncan be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those\nthat eat both plants and animals (omnivores). The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not\nimmediately accessible to the cells. There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body\nin order to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function. As animals evolved in\ncomplexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various\ndietary needs.\nHerbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores\nHerbivoresare animals whose primary food source is plant-based. Examples of herbivores, as shown in\nFigure 34.2include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as\ncrickets and caterpillars. These animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of\nplant material.

(credit a: modification of work by Dave\nMenke; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nInvertebrate Digestive Systems\nAnimals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. The\nsimplest example is that of agastrovascular cavityand is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.\nPlatyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of\ndigestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown inFigure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the\n\u201cmouth\u201d, which also serves as an \u201canus\u201d. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells\nwithin the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that breakdown the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the\ngastrovascular cavity.\nThealimentary canal, shown inFigure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an\nanus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the\nmouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is\nchurned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is\neliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.\n\n--- Page 970 ---\n950",

However, in the rabbit the small\nintestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material. The enlarged organ provides more surface area for absorption\nof nutrients. Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it\npasses as soft feces called cecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.\nAvian\nBirds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. They do not have teeth and so their digestive\nsystem, shown inFigure 34.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect\nthe vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are\nhigh in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers: the\nproventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and thegizzard, where the\nfood is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated.\nMost of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca.\n\n--- Page 972 ---\n952",

The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. These chambers\ncontain many microbes that breakdown cellulose and ferment ingested food. The abomasum is the \u201ctrue\u201d stomach and is the\nequivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted. The four-compartment gastric chamber\nprovides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. The fermentation process\nproduces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. As in other animals, the small intestine plays\nan important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.\nFigure34.8Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs. The first two stomachs, the rumen and the reticulum, contain\nprokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber. The ruminant regurgitates cud from the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it\ninto a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water. The cud then passes onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested\nby enzymes produced by the ruminant.\nPseudo-ruminants\nSome animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting\nplant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these\nanimals cannot breakdown cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system\nmust be able to handle large amounts of roughage and breakdown the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a three-chamber\nstomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum\u2014a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing\nmany microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials\u2014is large and is the site where the roughage is\nfermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.\nParts of the Digestive System\nThe vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that\nsustain organisms.\nOral Cavity\nThe oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated inFigure 34.9. The food consumed is\nbroken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food.\nThe extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary\nglands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands\nthat secrete saliva\u2014the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers\n\n--- Page 974 ---\n954",

In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens,\nand the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the\nstomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true sphincter,\nbut the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action. Acid reflux or \u201cheartburn\u201d occurs when the acidic\ndigestive juices escape into the esophagus.\nStomach\nA large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown inFigure 34.11. Thestomachis a saclike organ that secretes gastric\ndigestive juices. The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5. This highly acidic environment is required for the chemical\nbreakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients. When empty, the stomach is a rather small organ; however, it can expand to\nup to 20 times its resting size when filled with food. This characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat when\nfood is available.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure34.11The human stomach has an extremely acidic environment where most of the protein gets digested.

The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen.\nThe human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The \u201cC-\nshaped,\u201d fixed part of the small intestine is called theduodenumand is shown inFigure 34.11. The duodenum is separated from\nthe stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the\nduodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of\nchyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver,\nand gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum.Bileis produced in the liver and\nstored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes\nthat catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices breakdown the food particles in the chyme into\nglucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids\nalso takes place in the duodenum.\nThe second part of the small intestine is called thejejunum, shown inFigure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued\nwhile most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and\nnutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.\nTheileum, also illustrated inFigure 34.11is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed\ninto the bloodstream. The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. The\nileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, \u201cworm-like,\u201d appendix is located at the ileocecal\nvalve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.\nLarge Intestine\nThelarge intestine, illustrated inFigure 34.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste\nmaterial. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has\nthree parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the\nwaste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestive processes. The colon can be\ndivided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. The main\nfunctions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. Carnivorous\nmammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.\nFigure34.13The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated.\nRectum and Anus\nTherectumis the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown inFigure 34.13. The primary role of the rectum is to store the\nfeces until defecation. The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. Theanusis an opening at the\nfar-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control\nelimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.\nAccessory Organs\nThe organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. Accessory organs are organs that\nadd secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas,\n\n--- Page 978 ---\n958",

Carbohydrates or sugars are the\nprimary source of organic carbons in the animal body. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down\ninto glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be\nbroken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack\nthe ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. In humans, these molecules provide the fiber required for moving\nwaste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition\nfrom these plant fibers. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles for later\nuse. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food\nshortage. Excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower layer of the skin of mammals for insulation and\nenergy storage. Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in order to survive famine and aid in mobility.\nAnother important requirement is that of nitrogen. Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen. Amino acids are\nthe building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function. The carbon and\nnitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues. Excess\nnitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic. Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also\nsignificant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories. Fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of\nfat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.\nEssential Nutrients\nWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are some\nnutrients that need to be consumed from food. These nutrients are termedessential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten,\nand the body cannot produce them.\nThe omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane\nphospholipids.Vitaminsare another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes\nto function and, for this reason, are considered to be coenzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on\nhealth, as outlined inTable 34.1andTable 34.2. Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must be obtained from food.\nMinerals, listed inTable 34.3, are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. Among their many functions,\nminerals help in structure and regulation and are considered cofactors. Certain amino acids also must be procured from food\nand cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the \u201cessential\u201d amino acids. The human body can synthesize only\n11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food. The essential amino acids are listed inTable 34.4.\n\n--- Page 980 ---\n960",

                "text": "\u2022 Digestive System Processes 965\nDigestion and Absorption\nDigestionis the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small organic fragments. It is important to breakdown\nmacromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. Large, complex\nmolecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before they can be\nabsorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. Different organs play specific roles in the digestive process. The animal diet needs\ncarbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance. How each of these\ncomponents is digested is discussed in the following sections.\nCarbohydrates\nThe digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into\nmaltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of\ncarbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The acidic\nenvironment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.\nThe next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the\nduodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain\namylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. The disaccharides are broken\ndown into monosaccharides by enzymes calledmaltases,sucrases, andlactases, which are also present in the brush border of\nthe small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken\ndown by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or \u201ctable sugar\u201d) into glucose and fructose, and lactase\nbreaks down lactose (or \u201cmilk sugar\u201d) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed\nand then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal\nepithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate digestion are\nsummarized inFigure 34.16andTable 34.5.\nFigure34.16Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes. Starch and glycogen are broken down into glucose by amylase\nand maltase. Sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar) are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively.\nDigestion of Carbohydrates\nSite of Substrate\nEnzyme Produced By End Products\nAction Acting On\nPolysaccharides Disaccharides (maltose),\nSalivary amylase Salivary glands Mouth\n(Starch) oligosaccharides\nSmall Polysaccharides Disaccharides (maltose),\nPancreatic amylase Pancreas\nintestine (starch) monosaccharides\nLining of the intestine; brush Small Monosaccharides (e.g., glucose,\nOligosaccharidases Disaccharides\nborder membrane intestine fructose, galactose)\nTable34.5\n\n--- Page 986 ---\n966",

However, the bulk of lipid digestion occurs\nin the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger the release of\nbile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily triglycerides by\nemulsification. Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small lipid globules. These\nsmall globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. Lipids are hydrophobic\nsubstances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water. Bile contains bile salts,\nwhich are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Thus, the bile salts hydrophilic side can\ninterface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. By doing so, bile salts emulsify\nlarge lipid globules into small lipid globules.\nWhy is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that\nbreakdown lipids). If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available for the\nlipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface area of the\nlipids many fold. The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed inFigure 34.18.\nLipases breakdown the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. These molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell\nand enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming\ntiny spheres called micelles. The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where the long-chain\nfatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the micelles behind in the chyme. The\nlong-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules\nand become coated with proteins. These large spheres are calledchylomicrons. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol,\nand other lipids and have proteins on their surface. The surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate \"heads\" of\nphospholipids. Together, they enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water.\nChylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis. Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the\nsubclavian vein.\n\n--- Page 988 ---\n968",

No food is absorbed until the small intestine.\nElimination\nThe final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products. The undigested food material\nenters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called \u201cintestinal\nflora\u201d that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle\nand is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required\nto set up the urge to eliminate. The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum.\nCommon Problems with Elimination\nDiarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion. Constipation is a condition\nwhere the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon. In contrast, if enough water is not removed from the\nfeces, it results in diarrhea. Many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water\nreabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea.\n\n--- Page 990 ---\n970",

The functions of the digestive system are regulated\nthrough neural and hormonal responses.\nNeural Responses to Food\nIn reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown inFigure 34.20, the first response is that of salivation. The\nsalivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by food in preparation\nfor digestion. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. Recall that the peristaltic\nmovements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. The brain prepares these\nmuscles for movement as well. When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness. There are\nthree overlapping phases of gastric control\u2014the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase\u2014each requires many\nenzymes and is under neural control as well.\nFigure34.20Seeing a plate of food triggers the secretion of saliva in the mouth and the production of HCL in the stomach. (credit: Kelly\nBailey)\nDigestive Phases\nThe response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. The first phase of ingestion, called thecephalic phase, is\ncontrolled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects\u2014such as sight, sense, and smell\u2014trigger the\nneural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase\ncan also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the\nincrease in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive\nfood.\nThegastric phasebegins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase.\nGastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a\ndecrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. This phase consists of local, hormonal,\nand neural responses. These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 991 ---",

This phase controls the rate\nof gastric emptying. In addition to gastrin emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal and\nneural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.\nHormonal Responses to Food\nTheendocrinesystemcontrols the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate\ntimes.\nOne of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. During the gastric phase, the hormone\ngastrinis secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach\nacid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins. However, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic\nenvironment need not be maintained and a hormone calledsomatostatinstops the release of hydrochloric acid. This is\ncontrolled by a negative feedback mechanism.\nIn the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme\nduring the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone calledsecretinstimulates the pancreas to\nproduce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called\ncholecystokinin(CCK). Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also stimulates\nthe gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisitthis website(http://openstax.org/l/enteric_endo)to learn more about the endocrine system. Review the text and watch the\nanimation of how control is implemented in the endocrine system.\nAnother level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food. Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest.\nA hormone calledgastric inhibitory peptideis secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the\nintestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed.\nUnderstanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research. Scientists are exploring\nthe role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones. Advances could lead to\nknowledge that may help to battle the obesity epidemic.\n\n--- Page 992 ---\n972",

A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire\u2014it transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared\nto the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that\nare broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that they also usurp some of the signaling\nfunctions of neurons.\nThere is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system. There are four\nmajor types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.\nNeurons\nThe nervous system of the common laboratory fly,Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same\nnumber as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains\naround 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same\nbehaviors\u2014from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to\ncommunicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.\nMost neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized\u2014different types of neurons have\ndifferent sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.\nParts of a Neuron\nLike other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated inFigure 35.3for\nreceiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible.Dendritesare tree-like structures that\nextend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions calledsynapses. Although some\nneurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small protrusions called\ndendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.\nOnce a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized structure,\ntheaxon hillockthat integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and anaxon. An\naxon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings calledaxon terminals. These terminals\nin turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be\ncommunicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina,\ndo not contain any axons. Some axons are covered withmyelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the\nelectrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed of conduction. This insulation is important as the axon\nfrom a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter\u2014from the base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is not actually\npart of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are\ncallednodes of Ranvierand are sites where the signal is \u201crecharged\u201d as it travels along the axon.\nIt is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone\u2014neuronal communication depends on the connections that\nneurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive\nsynaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive\ncontact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.\n\n--- Page 1000 ---\n980",

Unipolar neurons have only one structure\nthat extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate\nmuscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is\na retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to\nganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar\nneuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and\nspinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but\nonly one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single\nprocess that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a\nbipolar cell.

Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are\nfulfilled by these glial cells.

Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in\nresponding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells. When glia do not function properly, the result\ncan be disastrous\u2014most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.\nTypes of Glia\nThere are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown inFigure 35.7.Astrocytes, shown in\nFigure 35.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances to\nneurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for\nsynapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier\u2014a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain.\nAstrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity,\ntransmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses.Satellite gliaprovide nutrients\nand structural support for neurons in the PNS.Microgliascavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading\nmicroorganisms.Oligodendrocytes, shown inFigure 35.8b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS.

These signals are possible because each\nneuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this\nmembrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To\nunderstand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or \u2018resting\u2019 membrane charge.\nNeuronal Charged Membranes\nThe lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron,\nions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different\nconfigurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated inFigure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open\nand allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape\naccordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels.\nVoltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in\ntotal charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called themembrane potential.\nFigure35.9Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage. After activation, they become inactivated for a\nbrief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis video discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.\nClick to view content(https://www.openstax.org/l/resting_neuron)\nResting Membrane Potential\nA neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (\u221270 mV,\nnote that this number varies by neuron type and by species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by\ndifferences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each\ntype of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the\nmembrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown inTable 35.1. The\ndifference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane\npotential (Figure 35.10). When the membrane is at rest, K+ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the\nconcentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of\ncations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell\nis created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons,\npotassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations\noutside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their\nconcentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels.\nTherefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell\nthan are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the\nsodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings\n\n--- Page 1006 ---\n986",

The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is\ninfluenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon\u2019s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents\ncurrent from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple\nsclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier,\nillustrated inFigure 35.13are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer\nlong and contain voltage-gated Na+and K+channels. Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na+channels,\nregenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. This \u2018jumping\u2019 of the action potential from one node to the\nnext is calledsaltatory conduction. If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action potential would propagate\nvery slowly since Na+and K+channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon\ninstead of at specific points. Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the\nnodes and not along the entire axon.\nFigure35.13Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons. Nodes contain voltage-gated K+and Na+channels. Action\npotentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.\n\n--- Page 1010 ---\n990",

The disease begins with muscle weakening and lack\nof coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease\ncan lead to paralysis. At that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate.\nSeveral special technologies have been developed to allow \u201clocked-in\u201d patients to communicate with the rest of the world.\nOne technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences can then be\nread aloud by a computer.\nA relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate and retain a\ndegree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated inFigure 35.17.

Other forms of BCI\nrequire the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor\ncortex.

These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a\ntool\u2014such as a cursor on a computer screen.

Recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to\ncontrol a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using BCI technology.\nDespite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations.

One\nmechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors\ninitiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as\nillustrated inFigure 35.18. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to\nglutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning\nand memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes\nthe synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.\nFigure35.18Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term\npotentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated. This stimulation causes a\ncalcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.\nThe next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus\ndepolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low\nfiring rate of the presynaptic neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein\nphosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors.

They use a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head; and they use\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that\ncorrelate with specific behavioral tasks. These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the functions of different\nbrain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process, and any\ngiven behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. That being said, each hemisphere of the\nmammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal,\nand occipital.Figure 35.21illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.\nFigure35.21The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.\n\n--- Page 1018 ---\n998"

Myelinated axons make up the \u201cwhite matter\u201d\nand neuron and glial cell bodies make up the \u201cgray matter.\u201d Gray matter is also composed of interneurons, which connect two\nneurons each located in different parts of the body. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal (facing the back of the animal) spinal cord\nconvey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the\nanimal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.\nThe spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements\u2014like automatically removing a\nhand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a\ndoctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a\nreflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit\ninformation to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).\nIn the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. Because the spinal cord is the information\nsuperhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. The extent of the paralysis\ndepends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed. For example, if\nthe spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas damage to the spinal\ncolumn further down may limit paralysis to the legs. Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves\ndo not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect\nsevered nerves.

(credit: modification of work by \u201cGarrando\u201d/Wikimedia Commons\nbased on original images by ADEAR: \"Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, a service of the National Institute on Aging\u201d)\nParkinson\u2019s Disease\nLike Alzheimer\u2019s disease,Parkinson\u2019s diseaseis a neurodegenerative disease. It was first characterized by James Parkinson in\n1817. Each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease. Parkinson\u2019s disease causes the loss of\ndopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement. Loss of these neurons causes many\nsymptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance and posture problems,\nand rigid muscles. The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk, illustrated in\nFigure 35.31. Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such as dementia or emotional\nproblems.\nAlthough some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact causes\nof Parkinson\u2019s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors\n(similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson\u2019s patients shows the presence of Lewy\nbodies\u2014abnormal protein clumps\u2014in dopaminergic neurons. The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates with the\nseverity of the disease.\nThere is no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. One of the most commonly prescribed\ndrugs for Parkinson\u2019s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain. This conversion\nincreases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the\nsubstantia nigra. Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.\n\n--- Page 1028 ---\n1008",

Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD, but for any given patient, many different\nmutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop. At a general level, ASD is thought to be a disease of\n\u201cincorrect\u201d wiring. Accordingly, brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected\npeople. In the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children. This paper was retracted when it\nwas discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism.\nTreatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other disorders\ncommon to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder). Although early interventions can help\nmitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for ASD.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nApproximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected byattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Like\nASD, ADHD is more prevalent in males than females. Symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack of focus), executive\nfunctioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage. Some\npatients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD: attention deficit\ndisorder (ADD). Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity, in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD.\nExamples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Figure 35.32provides some statistics concerning\ncomorbidity with ADHD.\nThe cause of ADHD is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex\nand disturbances in neurotransmission. According to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component. There are\nseveral candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered. Environmental factors,\nincluding exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some patients. Treatment for\nADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which paradoxically cause a calming\neffect in these patients.\nFigure35.32Many people with ADHD have one or more other neurological disorders.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin into the\npresynaptic neuron. This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Other types of drugs such as\nnorepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat\ndepression.\nOther Neurological Disorders\nThere are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories. These include chronic pain\nconditions, cancers of the nervous system, epilepsy disorders, and stroke. Epilepsy and stroke are discussed below.\nEpilepsy\nEstimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed withepilepsyin their lifetime. While\nthere are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy itself can be a symptom of a\nbrain injury, disease, or other illness. For example, people who have intellectual disability or ASD can experience seizures,\npresumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy. For\nmany patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and\nenvironmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very severe cases,\npatients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.\nStroke\nA stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without the oxygen\nsupplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms\u2014depending\non the brain area affected\u2014 including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems,\nmemory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel.\nStrokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States. On average one person\nexperiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65.\nRisk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke. Smoking doubles\nthe risk of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the\nemergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not work if the\nstroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital.\nTreatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense)\nphysical therapy.\n\n--- Page 1032 ---\n1012",

                        "text": ", people who have intellectual disability or ASD can experience seizures,\npresumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy. For\nmany patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and\nenvironmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very severe cases,\npatients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.\nStroke\nA stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without the oxygen\nsupplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms\u2014depending\non the brain area affected\u2014 including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems,\nmemory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel.\nStrokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States. On average one person\nexperiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65.\nRisk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke. Smoking doubles\nthe risk of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the\nemergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not work if the\nstroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital.\nTreatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense)\nphysical therapy.\n\n--- Page 1032 ---\n1012"

A\nmechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair-like tethers. When pressure causes the\nextracellular matrix to move, the channel opens, allowing ions to enter or exit the cell. (b) Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to\nmechanosensitive ion channels. When a sound causes the stereocilia to move, mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the\ncochlear nerve.\nSensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of\nstimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity. For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each\nactivated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure.\nHowever, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste.\nEncoding and Transmission of Sensory Information\nFour aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the\nreceptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted over a\nsensory receptor\u2019s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory\ncircuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of\nthe auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus\u2014a sound.\nThe intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an intense\nstimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production\nof action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An intense stimulus\nmight initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer\nreceptors.

These are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch and deformations\nwithin joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and movement. Thus, they\nalso contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia. Ruffini endings also detect warmth. Note that these warmth detectors are\nsituated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors. It is not surprising, then, that humans detect cold stimuli before they\ndetect warm stimuli.\n\n--- Page 1044 ---\n1024",

Carl Jaffe, MD,\ncardiologist)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPheromones\nApheromoneis a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species.\nPheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them, but pheromones apparently are not consciously\nperceived in the same way as other odors. There are several different types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as\nglandular secretions. Certain pheromones are attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors of\nthe same sex, and still others play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also influence the timing of\npuberty, modify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. While the roles of pheromones in many\nnonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over evolutionary time\ncompared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.\nThe vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson\u2019s organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many vertebrate animals\nthat sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected to the nasal cavity by a duct. When\nmolecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them\nbind with specialized pheromone receptors. Upon exposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals,\nincluding cats, may display the flehmen response (shown inFigure 36.9), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone\nmolecules enter the VNO.\nPheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects directly to the\namygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such as fear). The pheromonal signal then\ncontinues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive physiology and behavior. While some scientists assert that\nthe VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in humans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal\ncavities, others are researching it as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of\nmenstrual cycles in women living in close proximity.\n\n--- Page 1048 ---\n1028",

(credit: modification of work by Vincenzo Rizzo)\nIn humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. Thus, like olfaction, each\nreceptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect\nthe molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that enter the taste\nneurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. Binding of an acid or\nother sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H+) concentrations in the\ntaste neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor. These tastants\nbind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.\nBoth tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue to\ndecline. A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and unappetizing.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView thisanimation(http://openstax.org/l/taste)that shows how the sense of taste works.\nSmell and Taste in the Brain\nOlfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons.

It enables an organism to\ndetect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like\nthose concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular\nsystem is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animal\u2019s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular\nacceleration and deceleration, and balance.\nSound\nAuditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water.\nThere are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The speed of sound waves differs, based\non altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20\u00ba C (68\u00ba F), sound waves travel in the air at about\n343 meters per second.\nAs is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude.\nFrequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. High-frequency (\u226515.000Hz) sounds are\nhigher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; \u2264100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in cycles per\nsecond, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can perceive sounds with\nfrequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone\u2019s ability to hear\nhigh frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins\n150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those frequencies above the human range are\ncalledultrasound.\nAmplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated inFigure 36.12. The\nsound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. For sound, volume is measured in decibels\n(dB). The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.\nFigure36.12For sound waves, wavelength corresponds to pitch. Amplitude of the wave corresponds to volume.

(credit: NIH)\nReception of Sound\nIn mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called thepinna, then travel through the\nauditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called thetympanumor ear drum, the innermost part of theouter ear\n(illustrated inFigure 36.13). Interior to the tympanum is themiddle ear. The middle ear holds three small bones called the\nossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are themalleus(also known as\nthe hammer), theincus(the anvil), andstapes(the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. The three\nossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of\nthe tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the\ntympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear.\nThese bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the\nbones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals\n(frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.\nFigure36.13Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic membrane. The\nmiddle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window, the exterior boundary of the inner ear. The\norgan of Corti, which is the organ of sound transduction, lies inside the cochlea.\nTransduction of Sound\nVibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air. When these pressure waves reach the ear,\nthe ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain perceives as\nsound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum\ntransmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the\noval window, which is the outermost structure of theinner ear. The structures of the inner ear are found in thelabyrinth, a\nbony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the\nstapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves\nin the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. Thecochleais a whorled structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors\nfor transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated inFigure 36.14). Inside the cochlea, thebasilar\nmembraneis a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochlea\u2019s center.\nThe mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at the\noutside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the whorl\n(where the cochlea is smallest).

As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve. Intensity\n(volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.\nFigure36.15The hair cell is a mechanoreceptor with an array of stereocilia emerging from its apical surface. The stereocilia are tethered\ntogether by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest member of their array, and closed when the array is\nbent toward the shortest member of their array.\nThe hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions,\naccording to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a\nspecific frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of\ngreater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. The difference in response frequency between adjacent\ninner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent different. Place theory,\nwhich is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency sounds\nselectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). Lower frequencies travel\nfarther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. The basic pitch-determining mechanism is\nbased on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. The place theory is the first step toward an\nunderstanding of pitch perception. Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be\nsome auditory \u201csharpening\u201d mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.\nWhen sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach to\nthe tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along the\nneural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs bend, they\nrelease an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central\nnervous system. The cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. The auditory system\nis very refined, and there is some modulation or \u201csharpening\u201d built in. The brain can send signals back to the cochlea, resulting\nin a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells\u2019 response to certain frequencies.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch ananimation(http://openstax.org/l/hearing)of sound entering the outer ear, moving through the ear structure,\nstimulating cochlear nerve impulses, and eventually sending signals to the temporal lobe.\nHigher Processing\nThe inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. About 90 percent of the afferent\nneurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons. Outer hair cells connect to\nonly 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. The afferent, bipolar neurons that\nconvey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, finally\nreaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.\n\n--- Page 1054 ---\n1034",

Animals are\nbombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. Fortunately, the visual\nsystems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli. The importance of vision to humans is further\nsubstantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual\ninformation.\nLight\nAs with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium\u2014a gas, a\nliquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum\n(Figure 36.17). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the\nfundamental unit of light\u2014a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum\nshows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as\nlight because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light.\nCertain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency)\nmanifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light\nat the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one\nnanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. Some\nother animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order\nto locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off).\nFigure36.17In the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light lies between 380 nm and 740 nm. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nWave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness. The standard unit of intensity of light is thecandela, which is\napproximately the luminous intensity of one common candle.\nLight waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and those\nwaves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves. What is termed \u201cwhite light\u201d is light that is\nperceived as white by the human eye. This effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in the human\neye. The apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects. Thus a red object reflects the red wavelengths\n\n--- Page 1056 ---\n1036",

Cones respond\nin intense light and are responsible for color vision. (credit: modification of work by Piotr Sliwa)\nThefoveais the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has a high density of cones.\nWhen you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the object\u2019s image falls on the\nfovea. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better viewed by the\nperipheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low\nlight. In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReview theanatomical structure(http://openstax.org/l/eye_diagram)of the eye, clicking on each part to practice identification.\nTransduction of Light\nThe rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal. Both rods and cones contain photopigments. In\nvertebrates, the main photopigment,rhodopsin, has two main parts (Figure 36.20): an opsin, which is a membrane protein (in\nthe form of a cluster of \u03b1-helices that span the membrane), and retinal\u2014a molecule that absorbs light. When light hits a\nphotoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear\n(trans) isomer. This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of\nNa+channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor. Thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized by\nexposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold (Figure 36.21).\n\n--- Page 1058 ---\n1038",

As a result, the membrane becomes hyperpolarized. The\nhyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell.\nTrichromatic Coding\nThere are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most responsive,\nas shown inFigure 36.22. Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are called S cones (\u201cS\u201d for\n\u201cshort\u201d); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M cones, for \u201cmedium\u201d); a third group responds maximally to light of\nlonger wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or \u201clong\u201d cones). With only one type of cone, color vision would not be possible, and a two-\ncone (dichromatic) system has limitations. Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic) system, resulting in full color vision.\nThe color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. The colors of the visual spectrum, running\nfrom long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue (470 nm), indigo\n(450 nm), and violet (425 nm). Humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about 500 levels of\nbrightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.\n\n--- Page 1060 ---\n1040",

Stare at the center of the flag (indicated by the white dot) for 45\nseconds, and then quickly look at a white background, noticing how colors appear.\nHigher Processing\nThe myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities of\nthe visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form, movement,\ndepth, and differences in brightness. Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on\ncolor and fine detail. Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the\nopposite side of the brain. This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek, for \u201ccrossing\u201d) found\nat the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.\nOnce in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of\nvisual information to humans and other animals. One route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing\nstation for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions\nremain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. When visual signals leave the thalamus, they\ntravel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions. One\nstream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (\u201cwhere\u201d) information. A second stream\nprojects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (\u201cwhere\u201d) and parvocellular (\u201cwhat\u201d) information.\nAnother important visual route is a pathway from the retina to thesuperior colliculusin the midbrain, where eye movements\nare coordinated and integrated with auditory information. Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to thesuprachiasmatic\nnucleus(SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body\u2019s internal clock, which controls\nourcircadian(day-long) cycle. The SCN sends information to the pineal gland, which is important in sleep/wake patterns and\nannual cycles.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView thisinteractive presentation(http://openstax.org/l/sense_of_sight)to review what you have learned about how vision\nfunctions.\n\n--- Page 1062 ---\n1042",

This class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by the\npituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary.Figure 37.4illustrates these\npeptide hormones.\nSecreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them. They are then released in response to\nstimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin. Amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water-soluble\nand insoluble in lipids. These hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors are found on\nthe surface of the target cells.\nFigure37.4The structures of peptide hormones (a) oxytocin, (b) growth hormone, and (c) follicle-stimulating hormone are shown. These\npeptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids.\n\n--- Page 1072 ---\n1052",

In this way, even though hormones\ncirculate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the\nnecessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number\nof specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity\nthroughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of\nhormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell\u2019s sensitivity to that hormone, and the\nresulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in\nincreased or decreased cell sensitivity.

This, in\nturn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression. This protein can be used\neither to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. In this way, the steroid\nhormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated inFigure 37.5.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure37.5An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein (HSP). Upon hormone binding,\nthe receptor dissociates from the heat shock protein and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the hormone-receptor complex binds\nto a DNA sequence called a hormone response element (HRE), which triggers gene transcription and translation. The corresponding protein\nproduct can then mediate changes in cell function.\nHeat shock proteins (HSP) are so named because they help refold misfolded proteins. In response to increased temperature (a\n\u201cheat shock\u201d), heat shock proteins are activated by release from the NR/HSP complex. At the same time, transcription of HSP\ngenes is activated. Why do you think the cell responds to a heat shock by increasing the activity of proteins that help refold\nmisfolded proteins?\nOther lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, have receptors located in the\nnucleus. While thyroxine is mostly hydrophobic, its passage across the membrane is dependent on transporter protein. Vitamin\nD diffuses across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. Once in the cell, both hormones bind to receptors in the\nnucleus. The hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes.\nPlasma Membrane Hormone Receptors\nAmino acid-derived hormones (with the exception of thyroxine) and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble)\nand therefore cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer\nsurface of the plasma membrane, viaplasma membrane hormone receptors. Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble\nhormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA. Binding of these\nhormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out\nthe specific effects associated with the hormone. In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that\nbinds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell. The hormone that\ninitiates the signaling pathway is called afirst messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.6.\n\n--- Page 1074 ---\n1054",

                "text": "\u2022 Regulation of Body Processes 1055\nHormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. The key regulatory processes that will be\nexamined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations,\ngrowth, and the stress response.\nHormonal Regulation of the Excretory System\nMaintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia). The water\nconcentration of the body is monitored byosmoreceptorsin the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of electrolytes in\nthe extracellular fluid. The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive\nperspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. An increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a\nneuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two components: anterior\nand posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones. The posterior pituitary is an\nextension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known asantidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is transported to and\nreleased from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the\nkidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and\nwastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH\nsecretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress can\ncause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained, causing an\nincrease in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes the kidneys to\nbecome more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels, aquaporins, into the kidney tubules. Water moves\nout of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is reabsorbed into the capillaries lowering\nblood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor\nactivity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can be reduced by certain substances, including\nalcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.\nChronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results indiabetes insipidus. If the posterior pituitary\ndoes not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but\nwater taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur, but\nsevere cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.\nAnother hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids isaldosterone, a steroid\nhormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain\nproper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+reabsorption and K+secretion from\nextracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the\nconcentrations of minerals Na+and K+, aldosterone is referred to as amineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects ion and\nwater balance. Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood pressure, or an\nincrease in blood potassium levels. It also prevents the loss of Na+from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice. The reabsorption of Na+\nalso results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure.\nAldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.7. When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. Cells in the\njuxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and releaserenin. Renin, an\nenzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen. When\nangiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs.\nAngiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, resulting\nin increased Na+reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II in addition to being a potent\nvasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood pressure.\n\n--- Page 1076 ---\n1056",

(credit: Bryce Edwards)\nSome athletes attempt to boost their performance by using artificial hormones that enhance muscle performance. Anabolic\nsteroids, a form of the male sex hormone testosterone, are one of the most widely known performance-enhancing drugs.\nSteroids are used to help build muscle mass. Other hormones that are used to enhance athletic performance include\nerythropoietin, which triggers the production of red blood cells, and human growth hormone, which can help in building\nmuscle mass. Most performance enhancing drugs are illegal for nonmedical purposes. They are also banned by national and\ninternational governing bodies including the International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National\nCollegiate Athletic Association, the Major League Baseball, and the National Football League.\nThe side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and nonreversible, and in some cases, fatal. Androgens produce\nseveral complications such as liver dysfunctions and liver tumors, prostate gland enlargement, difficulty urinating,\npremature closure of epiphyseal cartilages, testicular atrophy, infertility, and immune system depression. The physiological\nstrain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle, leading to unpredictable and dangerous\neffects and linking their use to heart attacks, strokes, and impaired cardiac function.\nRegulation of the Female Reproductive System\nIn females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells produce\nthe hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and\nstimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated inFigure 37.9. Estradiol and progesterone are\nsteroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both\nestradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.\n\n--- Page 1078 ---\n1058",

Iodides obtained from the\n3 4\ndiet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher than in blood.\nThe typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table salt. Inadequate\niodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T and T hormones. The thyroid\n3 4\ngland enlarges in a condition calledgoiter, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid\nhormone. Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid\naccumulation in the thyroid. In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid begins to accumulate\nmore and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.\nDisorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones.Hypothyroidism,\nunderproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and\nreduced mental activity, among other symptoms. In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to mental\nretardation and growth defects.Hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased metabolic\nrate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate. Graves\u2019 disease is one example of\na hyperthyroid condition.\nHormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels\nRegulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which are\nelectrically stimulated.

If calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or muscle spasms can\nresult.\nBlood calcium levels are regulated byparathyroid hormone (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.12. PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2+levels. PTH increases Ca2+levels by targeting the skeleton, the\nkidneys, and the intestine. In the skeleton, PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed, releasing Ca2+from\nbone into the blood. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing Ca2+deposition in bone. In the intestines, PTH increases dietary\nCa2+absorption, and in the kidneys, PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2+. While PTH acts directly on the kidneys to\nincrease Ca2+reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect.

The\nendocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development, growth, energy metabolism,\nreproduction, and many behaviors. The nervous system releases neurotransmitters or neurohormones that regulate neurons,\nmuscle cells, and endocrine cells. Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones, the nervous and endocrine systems\nwork in a coordinated manner to regulate the body's physiology.\nHypothalamic-Pituitary Axis\nThehypothalamusin vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ\nlocated in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses\nto environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along\naxons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the\nanterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via\nneuronal control.\nThepituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or \u201cmaster gland\u201d is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a\ngroove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated inFigure 37.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the\npituitary stalk(or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting\nhormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release\nhormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions\u2014the anterior pituitary and the posterior\npituitary\u2014which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland\ncontains axons of the hypothalamic neurons.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1087 ---",

(credit\na: modification of work by NCI; credit b: modification of work by Gray\u2019s Anatomy)\nAnterior Pituitary\nTheanterior pituitarygland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus,\ndown along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. This capillary network is a part of thehypophyseal portal system\nthat carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the\ncirculatory system. A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore, the hypophyseal portal\nsystem allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the\ncirculatory system.\nThe anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),\nmelanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and\nluteinizing hormone (LH). Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they control the\nfunctioning of other organs. While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by\nregulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting\nhormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. These travel from the hypothalamus through\nthe hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect. Negative feedback then regulates how\nmuch of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is secreted.\nPosterior Pituitary\nTheposterior pituitaryis significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. It is a part of the brain, extending down\nfrom the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from the\nhypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the\nneurohypophysis.\nThe hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the\nhypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. They are released into the\ncirculatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus. These hormones are considered to be posterior pituitary\nhormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the circulatory\nsystem. The posterior pituitary itself does not produce hormones, but instead stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus\nand releases them into the bloodstream.\nThyroid Gland\nThethyroid glandis located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown inFigure 37.16. It is a\nbutterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by theisthmus. It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular\nsystem. When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck.\n\n--- Page 1088 ---\n1068",

PTH (1) enhances reabsorption of Ca2+by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity and inhibits\nosteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances Ca2+absorption by\nthe digestive system.

These hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell formation in children and women.\nAdrenal Glands\nTheadrenal glandsare associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated inFigure 37.18.

These include\nthe heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.\nThe heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. These cells release the\nhormoneatrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)in response to increased blood volume. High blood volume causes the cells to be\nstretched, resulting in hormone release. ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na+, causing Na+and water to be\nexcreted in the urine. ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal\ncortex, further preventing the retention of water. In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and\nreduces the concentration of Na+in the blood.\nThe gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the\nGI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and\ncholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas,\ngallbladder, and liver. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.\nWhile the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are majorendocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess\nendocrine function. Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na+and water, raising\nblood volume. The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca2+and phosphate ions.Erythropoietin (EPO)\nis a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO is released in response to low\noxygen levels. Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery throughout\nthe body. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater\nendurance. Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks.\nThethymusis found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood. The\nthymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response.\nAdipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body. It produces the hormoneleptinin response to food intake.\nLeptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety\nafter eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. Leptin is also associated with reproduction. It\nmust be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if\nadipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.\n\n--- Page 1094 ---\n1074",

(b) Spinal curves increase the strength and flexibility of the spine. (credit a: modification of work by\nUwe Gille based on original work by Gray's Anatomy; credit b: modification of work by NCI, NIH)\nEach vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. There is also a notch on each\nside through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral column is\napproximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The names of the\nspinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve\ninwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of\nthe body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a\nspring (Figure 38.8).\nIntervertebral discscomposed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the\nsacrum. Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from\nmovements such as walking and running. Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. The inner part of\ndiscs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. This loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb\nshocks.\nThe Thoracic Cage\nThethoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae,\nand costal cartilages (Figure 38.9). The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity, including the heart\nand lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment point for the\ndiaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing.\nThesternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. It is formed from three bones that fuse in the\nadult. Theribsare 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body,\nforming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of rib pairs 11 and\n\n--- Page 1108 ---\n1088",

Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular\nmatrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active\nosteocytes.Osteoclastsare large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes\nand acids that dissolve the bony matrix. These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium\nconcentrations in body fluids. Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have changed.Osteocytesare\nmature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide. Osteocytes maintain normal bone\nstructure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix.Osteoprogenitor cellsare squamous stem cells that divide to produce\ndaughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts. Osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures.\nDevelopment of Bone\nOssification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Ossification is distinct from the process of\ncalcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. Ossification\nbegins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of\nfibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous\nossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth continues until approximately\nage 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and\nrepair.\nIntramembranous Ossification\nIntramembranous ossificationis the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation of\nthe flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the\nfuture bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and\ndeposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood\nvessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus. The spongy bone\nis remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.\nEndochondral Ossification\nEndochondral ossificationis the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. All of the bones of the body, except for the\nflat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification.\n\n--- Page 1118 ---\n1098",

Bones that are\nnot subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass. A fractured or broken bone undergoes\nrepair through four stages:\n1. Blood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at the\nsite of the break. The severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and bone cells\nthat are deprived of nutrients begin to die.\n2. Within days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead cells.\nThough fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone.\nFibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone. The\nrepair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline and\nfibrocartilage (Figure 38.22). Some bone spicules may also appear at this point.\n3. The fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone.

Joints are responsible for movement, such as the\nmovement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.\nClassification of Joints on the Basis of Structure\nThere are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. The structural classification\ndivides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the\npresence or absence of a cavity in the joint.\nFibrous Joints\nThe bones offibrous jointsare held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones\nand so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. There are three types of fibrous joints:\nsutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses.Suturesare found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that\nhold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 38.23).\nFigure38.23Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.\nSyndesmosesare joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a\nsuture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in these types of\njoints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers.Gomphosesoccur between teeth and their sockets; the term\nrefers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 38.24). The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue\nreferred to as the periodontal ligament.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1121 ---",

(credit: modification of work by Gray's Anatomy)\nCartilaginous Joints\nCartilaginous jointsare joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints:\nsynchondroses and symphyses. In asynchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the\nepiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. Insymphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection\nbetween bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type of cartilaginous\njoint allows for very little movement.\nSynovial Joints\nSynovial jointsare the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 38.25). This space is referred to as the\nsynovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones\nand allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire\njoint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting\ndislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the\ngreatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and\nshoulders are examples of synovial joints.\n\n--- Page 1122 ---\n1102",

This action requires energy,\nwhich is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site\nfor ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.\nATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly\nbound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The\ni\nenergy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a \u201ccocked\u201d position. The myosin head is then in\na position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and P are still attached. If actin binding sites are\ni\ncovered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.\nIf the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin\n\n--- Page 1132 ---\n1112",

To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin,\nregulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites.Tropomyosinblocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing\ncross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input.Troponinbinds to tropomyosin and\nhelps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium ions.\nTo enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin\nmolecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. This can only happen in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low\nconcentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that\nallow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin. Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can\nform between actin and myosin, triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling continues until Ca2+ions and ATP are no longer\navailable and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.\nExcitation\u2013Contraction Coupling\nExcitation\u2013contraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the\nstart of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural\nsignal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the\nmuscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called themotor end plate. The end of\nthe neuron\u2019s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space called the\nsynaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the neuron\u2019s axon, which\nbranches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.\nThe ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their\ncell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane. Each ion\nexerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence. Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir,\nions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly\nmixed state.\nThe sodium\u2013potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K+ions inside the cell and Na+ions outside. This alone accumulates\na small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. There is lots of K+in the cell and lots of Na+outside the cell.\nPotassium is able to leave the cell through K+channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. However, Na+channels are\nrarely open, so Na+remains outside the cell. When K+leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that effectively leaves a\nnegative charge behind. So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na+to enter the cell, and there is an accumulation\nof negative charges left behind in the cell. This is the resting membrane potential. Potential in this context means a separation of\nelectrical charge that is capable of doing work. It is measured in volts, just like a battery. However, the transmembrane potential\nis considerably smaller (0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is\nnegative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of negative charges inside the cell, \u221270 mV.\nIf an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na+ions, they will enter the cell. That will change the voltage. This is an\nelectrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal. Communication occurs between nerves and\nmuscles through neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic\nterminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the\nmotor end plate. The motor end plate possesses junctional folds\u2014folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the\nneurotransmitter to bind to receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of Na+into the\ncell when they receive a neurotransmitter signal.\nAcetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate.\n\n--- Page 1134 ---\n1114",

During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another\naction potential. The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. The\nsodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+back out of the cell and K+back into the cell, and the K+leaks out leaving\nnegative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized.\nControl of Muscle Tension\nNeural control initiates the formation of actin\u2013myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle\ncontraction. These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal\nmovement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. This enables\nthe same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced\ndepends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.\nThe number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can\nproduce. Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-\nbridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced.\nThe ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the\ngreatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the\ngreatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is\nproduced. As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed\nof myosin tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the\ntension produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each\nother\u2014reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched\nto the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. This\namount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose\nextreme stretching.\nThe primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action\npotential from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only\nsignals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if\nstimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber participates.\nThis is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials\n(the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.\n\n--- Page 1136 ---\n1116",

The main structures of the human respiratory system are the\nnasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs.\nAll aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree,\ndifferent organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere.\nThe environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the\nrespiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances\nincrease and the ratio of surface area to volume drops. In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell\nmembrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (Figure 39.2). Diffusion is a slow, passive transport\nprocess. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen\nuptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if the cell were very large or\nthick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore,\ndependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only\nfor small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes).\nLarger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages\naccompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.\nFigure39.2The cell of the unicellular algaVentricaria ventricosais one of the largest known, reaching one to five\ncentimeters in diameter. Like all single-celled organisms,V. ventricosaexchanges gases across the cell membrane.\nDirect Diffusion\nFor small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen\nneeds. Gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm\nin diameter. In simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the\nexternal environment. Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are\nsmall, literally flat worms, which \u2018breathe\u2019 through diffusion across the outer membrane (Figure 39.3). The\nflat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for diffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body\nis close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen. If the flatworm had a cylindrical body, then\nthe cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1145 ---",

A dense network of capillaries lies just below\nthe skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory surface must\nbe kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.\nOrganisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than\nin the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much lower than that.\nFish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (Figure 39.4). Gills are thin\ntissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly\ndiffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of\nthe body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid.\nGills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.\nFigure39.4This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water. (credit:\n\"Guitardude012\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nThe folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen.

The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is\nhigher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high\nconcentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown inFigure 39.5.

Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the\ncells of the body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into\nalveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional\nrelationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each\nalveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency. This organization\nproduces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75\nm2. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse\nacross the cells.\nFigure39.10Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs.

Because of the enormous number of alveoli\n(approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m2). Having such a large surface\narea increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs.\nBasic Principles of Gas Exchange\nGas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion. Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a\nconcentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Blood that is\nlow in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs. The air in\nthe lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide.\nThis concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.\nPartial pressureis a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. The total pressure exerted\nby the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. The rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional\nto its partial pressure within the total gas mixture. This concept is discussed further in detail below.\nLung Volumes and Capacities\nDifferent animals have different lung capacities based on their activities. Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung capacity\nthan humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. Elephants also have a high\nlung capacity. In this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be able to take up oxygen\nin accordance with their body size.\nHuman lung size is determined by genetics, sex, and height. At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters of\nair, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. Air in the lungs is measured in terms oflung volumesandlung\ncapacities(Figure 39.12andTable 39.1). Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation or exhalation).\nCapacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal exhalation).\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1151 ---",

Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is:\nand for carbon dioxide:\nAt high altitudes, P decreases but concentration does not change; the partial pressure decrease is due to the reduction in\natm\nP .\natm\nWhen the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified. The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change the\npressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation. For this calculation, the water pressure (47 mm Hg)\nis subtracted from the atmospheric pressure:\nand the partial pressure of oxygen is:\nThese pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system. Oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow according to\ntheir pressure gradient from high to low. Therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in understanding\nhow gases move in the respiratory system.\nGas Exchange across the Alveoli\nIn the body, oxygen is used by cells of the body\u2019s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. The ratio of carbon\ndioxide production to oxygen consumption is therespiratory quotient (RQ). RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0. If just glucose were\nused to fuel the body, the RQ would equal one. One mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole of oxygen\nconsumed. Glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body. Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body. Because of this,\nless carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the RQ is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and about 0.8 for protein.\nThe RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, thealveolar . Above, the\npartial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg. However, lungs never fully deflate with an exhalation;\ntherefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the alveoli. This means\nthat there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body. Knowing the RQ, the partial\npressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated:\nWith an RQ of 0.8 and a in the alveoli of 40 mm Hg, the alveolar is equal to:\nNotice that this pressure is less than the external air. Therefore, the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the lung ( = 150\nmm Hg) into the bloodstream ( = 100 mm Hg) (Figure 39.13).\nIn the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Oxygen (about 98 percent) binds\nreversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues where\noxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar is higher in the\nalveoli ( = 100 mm Hg) than blood (40 mm Hg) in the capillaries. Because this pressure gradient exists, oxygen\ndiffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the capillaries where O binds to\n2\nhemoglobin. At the same time, alveolar is lower = 40 mm Hg than blood = (45 mm Hg). CO diffuses down\n2\nits pressure gradient, moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli.\nOxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other; they diffuse down their own pressure gradients. As blood leaves\nthe lungs through the pulmonary veins, thevenous = 100 mm Hg, whereas thevenous = 40 mm Hg. As blood enters\n\n--- Page 1154 ---\n1134",

The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that facilitates\nbreathing. Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm.\nTypes of Breathing\nAmphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing. Young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they don\u2019t leave\nthe water. Some amphibians retain gills for life. As the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow. These lungs are\nprimitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs. Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via\nlungs is forced. The other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin. To aid this diffusion, amphibian skin\nmust remain moist.\nBirds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: They fly. Flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds\nrequire a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes. Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with the\noxygen needed to enable flying. Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange.\nOxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide\ndiffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. The details of breathing between birds and mammals\ndiffer substantially.\nIn addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and\nout of the anterior air sacs. The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place much more\nefficiently. This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where the oxygen\nconcentration is low. This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of\nthe lungs.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nAvian Respiration\nBirds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. Flying is a high-energy process and requires a lot of oxygen.\nFurthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen is low. How did birds evolve a respiratory\nsystem that is so unique?\nDecades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating dinosaurs (Figure 39.14). In\nfact, fossil evidence shows that meat-eating dinosaurs that lived more than 100 million years ago had a similar flow-through\nrespiratory system with lungs and air sacs.ArchaeopteryxandXiaotingia, for example, were flying dinosaurs and are believed\nto be early precursors of birds.\n\n--- Page 1156 ---\n1136",

This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere\n(Figure 39.16a). Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. To increase the volume of the lungs,\nthe chest wall expands. This results from the contraction of theintercostal muscles, the muscles that are connected to the rib\ncage. Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostal muscles contract, thus expanding the thoracic\ncavity. This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere, so air rushes into the\nlungs, thus increasing its volume. The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an increase in alveolar space, because\nthe bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.\nFigure39.16The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration. (credit: modification\nof work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe chest wall expands out and away from the lungs. The lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, theelastic recoil\nwithin the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces compete to\ninflate and deflate the lung with every breath. Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs, and the\nintercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 39.16b). The diaphragm also relaxes and\nmoves higher into the thoracic cavity. This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment, and air\nrushes out of the lungs. The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. No muscles are contracting to expel the air.\nEach lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac. The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral\npleura. A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax (Figure 39.17). The space between these layers, the\nintrapleural space, contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the\ntissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax.Pleurisyresults when these layers of tissue become inflamed; it is painful\nbecause the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung.\n\n--- Page 1158 ---\n1138",

Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are\ncompliance(how elastic the lung is) andresistance(how much obstruction exists in the airways). A change in either can\ndramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\nExamples ofrestrictive diseasesare respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. In both diseases, the airways are\nless compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. There is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move. In\nthese types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation, which\ntraps air in the lungs. Forced orfunctional vital capacity (FVC), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after\ntaking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is\ngreatly prolonged (Figure 39.18). A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of air.\nObstructive diseasesand conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. In emphysema, which mostly arises\nfrom smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. The overall\ncompliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a loss of\nelastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Asthma is a disease in which inflammation is\ntriggered by environmental factors. Inflammation obstructs the airways. The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid\naccumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of the\nairways, or a combination of these events. Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased\ninflammation of the airways. This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 39.18). Those\nwith obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume to\ncompensate for the lack of airway recruitment.\nFigure39.18The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep breath) to FVC (the total\namount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diagnose whether a person has restrictive or obstructive lung disease. In\nrestrictive lung disease, FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed, so the person is able to expel air reasonably fast. In obstructive lung\ndisease, airway obstruction results in slow exhalation as well as reduced FVC. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive\nlung disease (less than 69 percent) than in persons with restrictive disease (88 to 90 percent).\nDead Space: V/Q Mismatch\nPulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation. It is also independent of cardiac\noutput. This is because of a phenomenon calledrecruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain\nclosed when cardiac output increases. As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused\n(filled with blood) increases. These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. At times, however, there\nis a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs. This is referred to\nasventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.\nThere are two types of V/Q mismatch. Both producedead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue.

As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen is\ntransported through the body (Figure 39.22). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to detect. It\nis produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term\nexposure can cause brain damage or death. Administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for carbon\nmonoxide poisoning. Administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.\nFigure39.22As percent CO increases, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin decreases.\n\n--- Page 1164 ---\n1144",

                "text": "\u2022 Components of the Blood 1153\nIn amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart,\nwhich is calledpulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain\n(systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred\nto aspulmocutaneous circulation.\nAs shown inFigure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-\nchambered heart of fish. The twoatria(superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the\nsystems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart\u2019sventricle(inferior heart chamber), which reduces the\nefficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and\nbody. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory\nsystem and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having\ndouble circulation.\nMost reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and\nsystemic circuits, as shown inFigure 40.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less\nmixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to\nexhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs\ntoward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays\nunderwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes\nblood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations\ninclude a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side\nof the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations\nhave made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth.\nIn mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated inFigure 40.4d.\nThe oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is\nprobably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals\nevolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is\nreferred to as convergent evolution.",

Blood plasma is actually the dominant\ncomponent of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells are responsible for carrying the\ngases (red cells) and the immune response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood clotting.

                "text": "\u2022 Components of the Blood 1155\nFigure40.6In most vertebrates, (a) hemoglobin delivers oxygen to the body and removes some carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin is composed\nof four protein subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and a heme group that has iron associated with it. The iron reversibly\nassociates with oxygen, and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2+to Fe3+. In most mollusks and some arthropods, (b) hemocyanin delivers\noxygen. Unlike hemoglobin, hemolymph is not carried in blood cells, but floats free in the hemolymph. Copper instead of iron binds the\noxygen, giving the hemolymph a blue-green color. In annelids, such as the earthworm, and some other invertebrates, (c) hemerythrin\ncarries oxygen. Like hemoglobin, hemerythrin is carried in blood cells and has iron associated with it, but despite its name, hemerythrin\ndoes not contain heme.\nThe small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the plasma\nmembrane. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. In the tissues, oxygen is released from\nthe blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. Studies have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous\noxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of\nred blood cells through narrow vessels. Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart attacks, is converted to NO to\nhelp relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.\nA characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have\ncarbohydrate molecules attached. In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between\nindividuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, and O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days, at\nwhich time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood cell.\nWhite Blood Cells\nWhite blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in blood. The\nrole of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune response to\nidentify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. White blood cells are formed\ncontinually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.\nThe morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. They have nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin.\nThe different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining, and each has a\ndifferent specialized function. The two main groups, both illustrated inFigure 40.7are the granulocytes, which include the\nneutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and lymphocytes.\n\n--- Page 1176 ---\n1156",

The megakaryocyte breaks up into thousands of fragments\nthat become platelets. (b) Platelets are required for clotting of the blood. The platelets collect at a wound site in conjunction with other\nclotting factors, such as fibrinogen, to form a fibrin clot that prevents blood loss and allows the wound to heal.\nPlasma and Serum\nThe liquid component of blood is called plasma, and it is separated by spinning or centrifuging the blood at high rotations (3000\nrpm or higher). The blood cells and platelets are separated by centrifugal forces to the bottom of a specimen tube. The upper\nliquid layer, the plasma, consists of 90 percent water along with various substances required for maintaining the body\u2019s pH,\nosmotic load, and for protecting the body. The plasma also contains the coagulation factors and antibodies.\nThe plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called theserum. Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in\nwhich the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves. Other\ncomponents in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining pH and osmotic balance while giving viscosity to the\nblood. The serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and bacteria.\nLipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including nutrients,\nhormones, metabolic waste, plus external substances, such as, drugs, viruses, and bacteria.\nHuman serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and is synthesized in the liver. Albumin, which\nconstitutes about half of the blood serum protein, transports hormones and fatty acids, buffers pH, and maintains osmotic\npressures. Immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody\nmediated immunity.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nBlood Types Related to Proteins on the Surface of the Red Blood Cells\nRed blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The composition of these molecules is determined\nby genetics, which have evolved over time. In humans, the different surface antigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups\nwith more than 100 different antigens on each red blood cell. The two most well known blood groups are the ABO, shown in\nFigure 40.9, and Rh systems. The surface antigens in the ABO blood group are glycolipids, called antigen A and antigen B. People\nwith blood type A have antigen A, those with blood type B have antigen B, those with blood type AB have both antigens, and\npeople with blood type O have neither antigen. Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in the blood plasma and react with\nthe A or B antigens, if the two are mixed. When type A and type B blood are combined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood\noccurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with the opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney\ncausing kidney failure. Type O blood has neither A or B antigens, and therefore, type O blood can be given to all blood types.\n\n--- Page 1178 ---\n1158",

Blood is pumped from veins of the systemic circuit into the right atrium of the heart, then into the right ventricle. Blood then enters\nthe pulmonary circuit, and is oxygenated by the lungs. From the pulmonary circuit, blood reenters the heart through the left atrium. From\nthe left ventricle, blood reenters the systemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body. The coronary circuit, which\nprovides blood to the heart, is not shown.\nWhich of the following statements about the circulatory system is false?\na. Blood in the pulmonary vein is deoxygenated.\nb. Blood in the inferior vena cava is deoxygenated.\nc. Blood in the pulmonary artery is deoxygenated.\nd. Blood in the aorta is oxygenated.\nStructure of the Heart\nThe heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since the\nright side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the\nwhole body in the systemic circuit, as shown inFigure 40.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is\ndivided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium\nand one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump\nblood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from thesuperior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that\ncomes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from theinferior vena cavawhich drains blood\nfrom the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary\nsinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through\ntheatrioventricular valveor thetricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the\nbackflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve.\nAfter it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, bypassing thesemilunar valve(or\npulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves\nclose preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood\nfrom the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through thebicuspid valveor mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve\non the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through theaorta, the major artery of the body,\ntaking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the\naorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This\npattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.\n\n--- Page 1180 ---\n1160",

Themyocardiumconsists of the heart muscle cells that make up the\nmiddle layer and the bulk of the heart wall. The outer layer of cells is called theepicardium, of which the second layer is a\nmembranous layered structure called thepericardiumthat surrounds and protects the heart; it allows enough room for\nvigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures.\nThe heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. Thecoronary arteriesbranch from the aorta and\nsurround the outer surface of the heart like a crown. They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with\noxygen before converging again into thecoronary veinsto take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood\nwill be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit. The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood.\nAtherosclerosisis the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques. Because of the size (narrow) of the coronary arteries\nand their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries. The slowdown of blood flow and\nsubsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known asangina, and complete blockage of\nthe arteries will causemyocardial infarction: the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known as a heart attack.\nThe Cardiac Cycle\nThe main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. The\ncardiac cycleis the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart\nmuscles to contract and relax. The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. In each cardiac cycle, the heart contracts\n(systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase (diastole), where the\nheart fills with blood, as illustrated inFigure 40.12. The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood through the\natrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic \u201clup\u201d sound. Following\na brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery\ntransporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery). Closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic \u201cdup\u201d\nsound.\nFigure40.12During (a) cardiac diastole, the heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart. During (b) atrial systole, the atria\ncontract, pushing blood into the ventricles. During (c) atrial diastole, the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart.\nThe pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle.\nCardiomyocytes, shown inFigure 40.13, are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically\nand involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle. They are self-\nstimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes.\n\n--- Page 1182 ---\n1162",

The optimal\nsystolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats. The\noptimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating,\nsitting, and standing. Blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the action of smooth muscle, by\none-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself.\nHow Blood Flows Through the Body\nBlood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart. With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under high\npressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. In the aorta, the blood travels at 30 cm/sec.\nAs blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows dramatically to\nabout 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. While the diameter of each individual\narteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity, fluid should travel\nfaster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries\nbeing far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.\nThe slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient\nexchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. After the blood has passed through the capillary\nbeds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than the\ninitial rate in the aorta. Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and\nby the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity, blood is\nprevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow,\nit is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities.\nBlood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the body\u2019s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals.\nFor example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the digestive system\nand vasoconstriction of other vessels. During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood\nto the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction.

Out of 7,200 liters of fluid pumped by the average heart in a day, over 1,500 liters is filtered. (credit: modification of work\nby NCI, NIH)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nVertebrate Diversity in Blood Circulation\nBlood circulation has evolved differently in vertebrates and may show variation in different animals for the required amount of\npressure, organ and vessel location, and organ size. Animals with longs necks and those that live in cold environments have\ndistinct blood pressure adaptations.\nLong necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. The blood pressure required\nfrom the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg (mm Hg = millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure)\nto reach the height of a giraffe\u2019s head, which is 2.5 meters higher than the heart. However, if checks and balances were not in\nplace, this blood pressure would damage the giraffe\u2019s brain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. These checks and\nbalances include valves and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. Long-necked dinosaurs such as the\nsauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. This would have required a blood pressure of more\nthan 600 mm Hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart. Evidence for such an enormous heart does not\nexist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. It\nis likely that they did not routinely feed on tree tops but grazed on the ground.\nLiving in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. This is achieved by the veins and arteries being\nclose together so that heat exchange can occur. This mechanism is called a countercurrent heat exchanger. The blood vessels and\nthe whole body are also protected by thick layers of blubber to prevent heat loss. In land animals that live in cold environments,\nthick fur and hibernation are used to retain heat and slow metabolism.\nBlood Pressure\nThe pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of the\nblood vessels. Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures. In the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure near the\nheart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles.\nDuring systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the\nextra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties. The blood pressure of the systole\nphase and the diastole phase, graphed inFigure 40.19, gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure. For example, 120/80\nindicates a reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole. Throughout the cardiac cycle, the blood\ncontinues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate. This resistance to blood flow is calledperipheral resistance.\n\n--- Page 1188 ---\n1168",

Anelectrolyteis a solute that dissociates into ions when\ndissolved in water. Anon-electrolyte, in contrast, doesn\u2019t dissociate into ions during water dissolution. Both\nelectrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. The body\u2019s fluids include blood plasma,\nthe cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of\nthe body. The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) aresemi-permeable\nmembranes. Semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and\nwater. Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by\nmovement of solutes and/or water across the membrane. As seen inFigure 41.2, a cell placed in water tends\nto swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic or \u201clow salt\u201d environment. A cell placed in a solution with\nhigher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water\ninto the hypertonic or \u201chigh salt\u201d environment.

                "text": "\u2022 Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance 1175\nNeed for Osmoregulation\nBiological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food\nand water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or\nwhen a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire\nconsequences.\nMammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific\nconcentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and\nintracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid\ncompartments can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a\ndirect bearing on blood pressure.\nTransport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes\nElectrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. In water, sodium\nchloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na+) and the chloride ion (Cl\u2013). The most important ions, whose concentrations\nare very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and\nthe anions chloride (Cl-), carbonate (CO-2), bicarbonate (HCO-), and phosphate(PO-). Electrolytes are lost from the body\n3 3 3\nduring urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of\nincreased activity and perspiration.\nOsmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to the number of solute\natoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Because electrolytes dissociate into their component\nions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure, per mass than\ncompounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.\nWater can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would\nbe impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms\nto cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active\ntransport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport requires energy in the\nform of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient.\nConcept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent\nIn order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for\nmeasuring solutes is themole. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular\nweight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. Themolarityof a solution is the\nnumber of moles of solute per liter of solution. Themolalityof a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of\nsolvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used to\nexpress the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter\n(mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion.\nThe unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous\nsolutions) and the charge on the ions.\nThus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two (like\ncalcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the\nmilliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually\nmaintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.\nOsmoregulators and Osmoconformers\nPersons lost at sea without any freshwater to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to\ndrinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a\nrelatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either\nfreshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for a few\nfishes like salmon to spend part of their life in freshwater and part in seawater. Organisms like the salmon and molly that can\ntolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms.

The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys filter\nblood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25\npercent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function.

The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called\nurine.\nFigure41.4Kidneys filter the blood, producing urine that is stored in the bladder prior to elimination through the urethra.

The first part is called theproximal convoluted tubule (PCT)due to its proximity to the glomerulus; it stays in the\nrenal cortex. The second part is called theloop of Henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (withdescendingand\nascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla. The third part of the renal tubule is called thedistal convoluted tubule\n(DCT)and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex. The DCT, which is the last part of the nephron, connects and empties its\ncontents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids. The collecting ducts amass contents from multiple nephrons\nand fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla.\nCapillary Network within the Nephron\nThe capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered. The\nbranch that enters the glomerulus is called theafferent arteriole. The branch that exits the glomerulus is called theefferent\narteriole. Within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed. Once the efferent arteriole\nexits the glomerulus, it forms theperitubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule.\nIn cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT. In juxtamedullary nephrons, the\nperitubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called thevasa recta.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGo tothis website(http://openstax.org/l/kidney_section)to see another coronal section of the kidney and to explore an\nanimation of the workings of nephrons.\n\n--- Page 1200 ---\n1180",

Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by\npassive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones.\nSodium (Na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular\ncapillaries. Because Na+is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. Water is also\nindependently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT. This\noccurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. However, every solute has a\ntransport maximumand the excess is not reabsorbed.\nIn the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the\nopposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt\nconcentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient increases as it\nmoves deeper into the medulla. Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as illustrated inFigure 41.8,\nit acts as acountercurrent multiplier. The vasa recta around it acts as thecountercurrent exchanger.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure41.8The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration gradients. The descending limb\nis water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal\nmedulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na+\nand Cl-ions exit through ion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na+is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl-\nfollows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).\nLoop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension. These drugs inhibit the reabsorption of Na+and Cl-ions by the\nascending limb of the loop of Henle. A side effect is that they increase urination. Why do you think this is the case?\nBy the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body requires additional\nwater, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later\nsection. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like\nmetabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in\n\n--- Page 1202 ---\n1182",

Planaria are flatworms that live in freshwater. Their excretory system consists of two tubules\nconnected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are calledflame cells(orprotonephridia) because they have\na cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated inFigure 41.10a. The cilia\npropel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw\nwater from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption. Flame cells are\nfound in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They also maintain the organism\u2019s osmotic balance.\nFigure41.10In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed by a tube cell. Tubules\nare connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the body. The filtrate is secreted through these\npores. In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the coelom, or body cavity. Beating cilia at the opening of the\nnephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule. As the filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed\nby capillaries. Filtered fluid containing nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of\nthe body.\nEarthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures callednephridia, illustrated inFigure 41.10b. A pair of\nnephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm. They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia.\nExcretion occurs through a pore called thenephridiopore. They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system\nfor tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion.\nMalpighian Tubules of Insects\nMalpighian tubulesare found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated inFigure 41.11. They are\nusually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted, which\nincreases their surface area, and they are lined withmicrovillifor reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance.\nMalpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. Body fluids are not filtered as in the\ncase of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that are bathed\nin hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks).\n\n--- Page 1204 ---\n1184",

Hormones are typically secreted from one cell and travel\nin the bloodstream to affect a target cell in another portion of the body.

Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones function by\nacting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict them. Once the afferent arterioles are constricted, blood flow\ninto the nephrons stops. These hormones go one step further and trigger therenin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem.\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, illustrated inFigure 41.15proceeds through several steps to produceangiotensin II,\nwhich acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume. Renin (secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex) is produced by the\ngranular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles. Thus, the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly. Renin acts on\nangiotensinogen, which is made in the liver and converts it toangiotensin I.Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)converts\nangiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. It also triggers the release of\nthe mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium.\nAngiotensin II also triggers the release ofanti-diuretic hormone (ADH)from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in\nthe kidneys. It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate. Medically, blood pressure can be controlled\nby drugs that inhibit ACE (called ACE inhibitors).\n\n--- Page 1208 ---\n1188",

Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune\nresponse involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication.\nThe innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential\nresponse to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat\ntriggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection\nindependently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus\nsecretions contain microbicidal factors.\nPhysical and Chemical Barriers\nBefore any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to\npotentially infectious pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out)\nand by the skin\u2019s acidity. In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with\ninvading pathogens, preventing infection.

Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the\nstomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell\nmembranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).\nDespite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting\non mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved\nspecific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter\nthe body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of\nimmune factors and proteins.\nPathogen Recognition\nAn infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and\nreplicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate\nintracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. The innate immune system must respond\naccordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been\ninfected.

This part of the immune system is activated when\nthe innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. In fact, without information from the innate immune\nsystem, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. There are two types of adaptive responses: thecell-mediated immune\nresponse, which is carried out by T cells, and thehumoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and\nantibodies. Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the\ninvading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens\nand disrupt the infection. Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from\nreinfection with the same type of pathogen; on reexposure, this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response.\nAntigen-presenting Cells\nUnlike NK cells of the innate immune system, B cells (B lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that gives rise to antibodies,\nwhereas T cells (T lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune response. T cells are a\nkey component in the cell-mediated response\u2014the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to neutralize cells that have\nbeen infected with viruses and certain bacteria. There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor T cells.\nCytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T cells play a part in activating\nboth the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor T cells deactivate T cells and B cells when needed, and\nthus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.\nAnantigenis a foreign or \u201cnon-self\u201d macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. Not all antigens will provoke a\nresponse. For instance, individuals produce innumerable \u201cself\u201d antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless foreign\nantigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. The suppression of immune responses to harmless\nmacromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.\nThe innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune\nresponse about the presence of these antigens. Anantigen-presenting cell (APC)is an immune cell that detects, engulfs, and\ninforms the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose the\npathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. Antigen fragments will then be transported to the\nsurface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells.Dendritic cellsare immune cells that process\nantigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.\nSometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning as an antigen-\npresenting cell. Macrophages also function as APCs. Before activation and differentiation, B cells can also function as APCs.\nAfter phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. Within the\nphagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC\nclass II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated inFigure 42.8. Note that T\nlymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule. APCs express\nMHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a \u201cnon-self\u201d invader. Once the\nfragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond. Helper T cells are one of the main\nlymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed MHC I\nmolecules, which signal \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\n--- Page 1222 ---\n1202",

T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens, calledepitopes,\npresented by APCs, illustrated inFigure 42.10. Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire\nantigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as \u201cantigenic determinants.\u201d In the absence of information from APCs, T and B cells\nremain inactive, or na\u00efve, and are unable to prepare an immune response. The requirement for information from the APCs of\ninnate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the innate immune response to the\nfunctioning of the entire immune system.\nFigure42.10An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system. A given antigen may contain several\nmotifs that are recognized by immune cells. Each motif is an epitope. In this figure, the entire structure is an antigen, and the orange,\nsalmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes.\nNa\u00efve T cells can express one of two different molecules, CD4 or CD8, on their surface, as shown inFigure 42.11, and are\naccordingly classified as CD4+or CD8+cells. These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with\nand respond to an APC. Na\u00efve CD4+cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to\nbecomehelper T (T ) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate B cells (or cytotoxic T cells) directly or secrete cytokines to\nH\ninform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat. In contrast, CD8+cells engage antigen-embedded MHC I\nmolecules on APCs and are stimulated to becomecytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis\nand emit cytokines to amplify the immune response. The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune\nprotection, but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors (TCRs). The CD4 or CD8 surface\nmolecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule. Because they assist in binding\nspecificity, the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors.\n\n--- Page 1224 ---\n1204",

These cells are\nH\nimportant for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa. T lymphocytes\nH\nrecognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs. There are two major populations of T cells: T 1 and\nH H\nT 2. T 1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. T 1 cells activate the action of\nH H H\ncyotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages. T 2 cells stimulate na\u00efve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion.\nH\nWhether a T 1 or a T 2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate\nH H\nimmune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.\nThe T 1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation. Recall the frontline defenses of\nH\nmacrophages involved in the innate immune response. Some intracellular bacteria, such asMycobacterium tuberculosis, have\nevolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed. These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy\nand digest the pathogen. WhenM. tuberculosisinfection occurs, macrophages can stimulate na\u00efve T cells to become T 1 cells.\nH\nThese stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities\nand allow it to destroy the colonizingM. tuberculosis. In the same manner, T 1-activated macrophages also become better\nH\nsuited to ingest and kill tumor cells. In summary; T 1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders while T 2 responses\nH H\nare aimed at those that are extracellular.\nB Lymphocytes\nWhen stimulated by the T 2 pathway, na\u00efve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Aplasma cellis an\nH\nimmune cell that secrets antibodies; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens. Similar to T cells, na\u00efve B\ncells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors (BCRs), which are membrane-bound forms of Ig (immunoglobulin, or\nan antibody). The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages. Each chain has a\nconstant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding. Two other membrane proteins, Ig alpha and Ig beta, are\ninvolved in signaling. The receptors of any particular B cell, as shown inFigure 42.13are all the same, but the hundreds of\nmillions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types\nof molecular structures to which they can bind. In this state, B cells function as APCs. They bind and engulf foreign antigens via\ntheir BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to T 2 cells. When a T 2 cell detects that a B\nH H\ncell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes\nthousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition\npattern as the BCRs. The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that\nvariant is known asclonal selection. This phenomenon drastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of BCR variants\nexpressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen.\n\n--- Page 1226 ---\n1206",

Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue,\nwhich functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components.\nMucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), illustrated inFigure 42.15, is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with\nepithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of\nthe body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell\ntypes. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to\nAPCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. M cells function in the transport described, and are located in the Peyer\u2019s patch,\na lymphoid nodule. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with B cells and macrophages having\nminor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites,\nsuch as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine. Activated T cells then migrate through\nthe lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection.\n\n--- Page 1228 ---\n1208",

This process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve many obstacles along the way. For instance,\ninjected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system, eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on\nthe mucosal response, which presents a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal\ncompartments, and the injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. For this reason,\nvaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol, oral, or transcutaneous\n(absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. Importantly, mucosal-administered vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic\nimmunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as injected vaccines.\nFigure42.19The polio vaccine can be administered orally. (credit: modification of work by UNICEF Sverige)\nCurrently, a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available, and the polio and typhoid vaccines can be administered orally, as\nshown inFigure 42.19. Similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices.\nEventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to produce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance.\nOther vaccines may be adapted to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or\nreproductive mucosa. Finally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped\nand microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune response, this new\ngeneration of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn, improve patient participation.\n\n--- Page 1232 ---\n1212",

Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity. Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus\nsecretions, and in breast milk. Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by\nphagocytes before they can infect cells.\nAntibody Structure\nAn antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: two identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially bound\nto each other in a \u201cY\u201d formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units), as illustrated inFigure\n42.22. Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other. The areas where\nthe antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant domains.\nIn germ-line B cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (V) and five joining (J) segments. An enzyme called\nDNA recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene, and splices one V segment to one J segment.\nDuring RNA processing, all but one V and J segment are spliced out. Recombination and splicing may result in over 106possible\nVJ combinations. As a result, each differentiated B cell in the human body typically has a unique variable chain.

BCRs on na\u00efve B\ncells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class. IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies. Prior to\nantibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies) linked by a joining (J)\nchain, as shown inFigure 42.23. The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens.\nHowever, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs, which are\none of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon reexposure to the same pathogen.Figure 42.23\nsummarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures.\nFigure42.23Immunoglobulins have different functions, but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a Y-shaped structure.\nIgAs populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts.\nCollectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans). The total number of IgA\nmolecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG molecules in the blood serum. A small amount of IgA is\nalso secreted into the serum in monomeric form. Conversely, some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of the mucosa. Similar to\nIgM, IgA molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a J chain. However, IgAs are secreted mostly as dimeric\nmolecules, not pentamers.\nIgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator. IgD is also present in\nsmall quantities. Similar to IgM, BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of na\u00efve B cells. This class supports antigen\nrecognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells.\nAntibody Functions\nDifferentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly\nsignificant against extracellular pathogens and toxins. Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells.\nAntibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease. For instance, a\nperson who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a\nnonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor\u2019s blood serum. This phenomenon is\ncalledpassive immunity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to\ninfections during the first few months of life.\nAntibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated inFigure 42.24, by blocking key sites on the pathogen\nthat enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that \u201cdock\u201d pathogens on host cells). Antibody neutralization can prevent\npathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are already\ninfected to prevent progression of an established infection. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by\nthe spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.\n\n--- Page 1236 ---\n1216",

(b) An antibody may cross react with different epitopes.\nThe termaviditydescribes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as IgM and IgA).\nAlthough avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the\nantibodies in a multimeric structure. The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being\ndetected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric IgM, are classified\nas having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. Essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind\nmany antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction.\nAntibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on\ndifferent antigens. Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino acids), it is\npossible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions.Cross\nreactivitydescribes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but to a different\nantigen.\nCross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been\nexposed to or vaccinated against one of them. For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface\nstructures of various Gram-negative bacteria.

In the competition between immune\nprotection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation\ntime and other characteristics. For instance,Streptococcus pneumoniae(bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis)\nsurrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune\nsystem.Staphylococcus aureus(bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called\nleukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system.\nHIV infects T cells via their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of T cells in the body; this inhibits the\nH H\nadaptive immune system\u2019s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. As a result, HIV-infected individuals\noften suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause\ndevastating illness to immune-compromised individuals. Maladaptive responses of immune cells and molecules themselves can\nalso disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system, leading to host cell damage that could become fatal.\nImmunodeficiency\nFailures, insufficiencies, or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and\nreplicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed.Immunodeficiencyis the failure,\ninsufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited. Immunodeficiency can be\nacquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical\ntreatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of\nlymphocytes and elevate an individual\u2019s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Dozens of genetic disorders result in\nimmunodeficiencies, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte syndrome, and MHC II\ndeficiencies. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur. Neutropenia is one form in which the\nimmune system produces a below-average number of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most abundant phagocytes. As a result, bacterial\ninfections may go unrestricted in the blood, causing serious complications.\nHypersensitivities\nMaladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are\ntermedhypersensitivities. The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. A large proportion of\nthe population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.\nAllergies\nThe immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs\nwithin minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called anallergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits\nsymptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon initial exposure to a\npotential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting\nprocessed antigen to T cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response\nH\nto parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This\nprocess primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE molecules on mast cells bind the\nantigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin;\nthese chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses.Figure 42.26shows an example of an\nallergic response to ragweed pollen.

Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some\nindividuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics. Delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune\nresponse to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on\nindividuals who were previously exposed toMycobacterium tuberculosis.

Both methods have advantages and\ndisadvantages.Asexual reproductionproduces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because\nthe offspring are all clones of the original parent. A single individual can produce offspring asexually and\nlarge numbers of offspring can be produced quickly. In a stable or predictable environment, asexual\nreproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that\nenvironment. In an unstable or unpredictable environment asexually-reproducing species may be at a\ndisadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to\nsurvive in new or different conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow\nfor a speedy response to environmental changes if individuals have mutations. An additional advantage of\nasexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats may be easier when an individual does not need to\nfind a mate to reproduce.\nDuringsexual reproductionthe genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically\ndiverse offspring that differ from their parents. The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is\nthought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment. Species\nthat reproduce sexually must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females, which can\nlimit the ability to colonize new habitats as both sexes must be present.\nAsexual Reproduction\nAsexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled\nand multi-celled organisms. There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually.\nFission\nFission, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-\ncelled organisms. After a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. Some\nunicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis. In other organisms, part of the\nindividual separates and forms a second individual. This process occurs, for example, in many asteroid\nechinoderms through splitting of the central disk.

These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number of chromosomes\nin each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.\nComplete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. Sperm are made in testes and then travel\nthrough coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. Eggs mature in the ovary.

Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs. When\ntestosterone is absent, the tissues develop into female sexual tissues. Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. Tissues that\nproduce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a\nfemale; that is, they are homologous structures.\nMale Reproductive Anatomy\nIn the male reproductive system, thescrotumhouses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for\nblood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. Thetestesare a pair of male reproductive organs that produce\nsperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in.) in size and divided into wedge-\nshaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.\nSperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated inFigure 43.8\nso that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the\nbody at about 2\u00b0C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm.

(credit b: modification of work\nby Mariana Ruiz Villareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. These are the seminal\nvesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated inFigure 43.8. Theseminal vesiclesare a\npair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. The glands make a solution that is thick, yellowish, and\nalkaline. As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal\nenvironment. The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic\nacid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen.\nThepenis, illustrated inFigure 43.8, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ\nduring intercourse. The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. These consist of a\npair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side, called the corpus\nspongiosum. This tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for intercourse. The organ\nis inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During intercourse, the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to\nthe renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. An orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory\norgans connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation. After\nintercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.\nThe walnut-shapedprostate glandsurrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. It has a series of short ducts\nthat directly connect to the urethra. The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. The muscle provides much of\nthe force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient),\nenzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes\nafter release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.\nThebulbourethral gland, or Cowper\u2019s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It neutralizes any\nacid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may\ncontain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm\nare present in the bulbourethral gland secretions. The location and functions of the male reproductive organs are summarized\ninTable 43.1.\nMale Reproductive Anatomy\nOrgan Location Function\nScrotum External Carry and support testes\nPenis External Deliver urine, copulating organ\nTestes Internal Produce sperm and male hormones\nTable43.1\n\n--- Page 1254 ---\n1234",

The pair of\novaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex: the medulla\ncontains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste.

Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid,\nundifferentiated cells. These stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with one\noffspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm.\nMeiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte. At the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced called\na secondary spermatocyte. This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division. The cell produced at the end of\nmeiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a sperm cell. Four\nsperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.\nStem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive state.\nDuring adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the production of\nviable sperm.

In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes\nthe release of hormones from the pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release offollicle stimulating hormone\n(FSH)andluteinizing hormone (LH)from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Note that the body must reach puberty in order\nfor the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced. Although FSH and LH are named after\ntheir functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction.\nOther hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.\nMale Hormones\nAt the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time.

LH also enters the testes and stimulates theinterstitial cells of Leydigto make and release testosterone into the testes and\nthe blood.\nTestosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence,\nstimulates spermatogenesis. These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary,\nand pubic hair, and the beginnings of the sex drive.\nFigure43.14Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.\nA negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior\npituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH. The Sertoli cells produce the hormoneinhibin, which is released into the\nblood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow\ndown. If the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.\nFemale Hormones\nThe control of reproduction in females is more complex. As with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release of\nthe hormones FSH and LH. In addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles.Estrogenis the\nreproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also responsible\nfor the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period\nnecessary for bone maturation.Progesteroneassists in endometrial regrowth and inhibition of FSH and LH release.\nIn females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells produce\nthe hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and\nstimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that\nprepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and\nprogesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.\nThe Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle\nTheovarian cyclegoverns the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while themenstrual cyclegoverns the\npreparation and maintenance of the uterine lining. These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22\u201332 day cycle,\nwith an average length of 28 days.\nThe first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown inFigure 43.15. Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH cause the\ngrowth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin\nreleasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy. The\ntrip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells. If\npregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual\ncycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated\nduring the end of the last cycle.\n\n--- Page 1260 ---\n1240",

(credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFollowing ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated inFigure 43.15and the menstrual cycle enters its\nsecretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured\nfollicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum\nproduces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of\nfurther FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of\nFSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of estrogen\nproduced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.\nIf no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone\ndecrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The\ndecrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and\nstarting the cycles again.Figure 43.17visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone\nlevels.\n\n--- Page 1262 ---\n1242",

The length of time of\ngestationvaries among animals, but is very similar among the great apes: human gestation is 266 days, while chimpanzee\ngestation is 237 days, a gorilla\u2019s is 257 days, and orangutan gestation is 260 days long. The fox has a 57-day gestation. Dogs and\ncats have similar gestations averaging 60 days. The longest gestation for a land mammal is an African elephant at 640 days. The\nlongest gestations among marine mammals are the beluga and sperm whales at 460 days.\nHuman Gestation\nTwenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte. When fertilized (at\nconception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18). The\ndeveloping embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of\nthe zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium\ncloses up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone calledhuman\nbeta chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG)which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures\nadequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo.\nPregnancy tests determine the level of\u03b2-HCG in urine or serum.

In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of\nglycoproteins called thezona pellucida. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of biochemical events, called the\nacrosomal reactions, take place. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation\nof the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane,\nas illustrated inFigure 43.23b. The fusion of these two membranes creates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is\ntransferred into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to\nform a diploid genome.\nFigure43.23(a) Fertilization is the process in which sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote. (b) Acrosomal reactions help the sperm degrade\nthe glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allow the sperm to transfer its nucleus. (credit: (b) modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nTo ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg\nmembrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg. If this mechanism\nfails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting inpolyspermy. The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies\nwithin a few days.\nCleavage and Blastula Stage\nThe development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the\nblastula. The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 43.24a). After the\ncleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the\nblastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). Mammals at this stage form a structure called the\nblastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown inFigure 43.24b. During\ncleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells.\nEach cell within the blastula is called a blastomere.\nFigure43.24(a) During cleavage, the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size. (b) The cells rearrange themselves\nto form a hollow ball with a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity called the blastula.\nCleavage can take place in two ways:holoblastic(total) cleavage ormeroblastic(partial) cleavage. The type of cleavage depends\non the amount of yolk in the eggs. In placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the mother\u2019s\nbody, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage. Other species, such as birds, with a lot of yolk\nin the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage.\nIn mammals, the blastula forms theblastocystin the next stage of development. Here the cells in the blastula arrange\nthemselves in two layers: theinner cell mass, and an outer layer called thetrophoblast. The inner cell mass is also known as the\nembryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo. At this stage of development, illustrated inFigure 43.25the\n\n--- Page 1270 ---\n1250",

Would you select the sex of your\nchild or select for their attractiveness, strength, or intelligence? How far would you go to maximize the possibility of\nresistance to disease? The genetic engineering of a human child, the production of \"designer babies\" with desirable\nphenotypic characteristics, was once a topic restricted to science fiction. This is the case no longer: science fiction is now\noverlapping into science fact. Many phenotypic choices for offspring are already available, with many more likely to be\npossible in the not too distant future. Which traits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much\ndebate within the worldwide medical community. The ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon, and some\nfear that modern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics.\nEugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic makeup of the human\nrace. The goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent (although controversial) in several countries\nduring the early 20thcentury, but fell into disrepute when Nazi Germany developed an extensive eugenics program in the\n1930s and 40s. As part of their program, the Nazis forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the so-called \"unfit\" and\nkilled tens of thousands of institutionally disabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior\nrace of Germans known as Aryans. Ever since, eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed, but there are still those\nwho promote them.\nEfforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with desired traits.\nIn fact, eugenicist Robert Klark Graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included samples exclusively from donors\nwith high IQs. The \"genius\" sperm bank failed to capture the public's imagination and the operation closed in 1999.\nIn more recent times, the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been developed. PGD involves the\nscreening of human embryos as part of the process ofin vitrofertilization, during which embryos are conceived and grown\noutside the mother's body for some period of time before they are implanted. The term PGD usually refers to both the\ndiagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos.\nIn the least controversial use of PGD, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic diseases such as\nsickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing allele or pair of alleles has been\nidentified. By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation into the mother, the disease is prevented, and\nthe unused embryos are either donated to science or discarded. There are relatively few in the worldwide medical\ncommunity that question the ethics of this type of procedure, which allows individuals scared to have children because of\nthe alleles they carry to do so successfully. The major limitation to this procedure is its expense. Not usually covered by\nmedical insurance and thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such\ncomplicated methodologies. Yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-cut, not everyone\nagrees with the morality of these types of procedures.

This process is calledorganogenesis. Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the\ncells within the embryo.\nOrganogenesis\nOrgans form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells\nexpress specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express\nthe genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is\nregulated by cellular signaling cascades.\nScientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (Drosophila) and the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans.\nDrosophilahave segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed scientists\nto study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points.

There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike in\nmammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.\nIn vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system.

During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules called\ngrowth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. The remaining cells in the center form\nthe neural plate.

These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. For instance, the Karner blue butterfly\n(Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Figure 44.3) is considered a specialist because the females onlyoviposit(that is, lay eggs) on wild\nlupine (Lupinus perennis). This specific requirement and adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is completely\ndependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its survival.\nFigure44.3The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas with few trees or shrubs,\nsuch as pine barrens and oak savannas. It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants. (credit: modification of work by J & K Hollingsworth,\nUSFWS)\nAfter hatching, the (first instar) caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine (Figure 44.4). The\ncaterpillars pupate as a chrysalis to undergo the final stage of metamorphosis and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks.\nThe adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species, such as milkweeds. Generally there are\ntwo broods of the Karner blue each year.\nA researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about\negg laying requirements, ask questions about the butterflies\u2019 preferred thoracic flight temperature (a physiological question), or\nthe behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages (a behavioral question).\n\n--- Page 1284 ---\n1264",

The biosphere extends into the atmosphere (several kilometers above Earth) and into the depths of the oceans.\nDespite its apparent vastness to an individual human, the biosphere occupies only a minute space when compared to the known\nuniverse. Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere.\nThe abiotic factors influence the distribution ofbiomes: large areas of land with similar climate, flora, and fauna.\nBiogeography\nBiogeographyis the study of the geographic distribution of living things and theabiotic factors that affect their distribution.\nAbiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation. As these abiotic factors change, the\ncomposition of plant and animal communities also changes. For example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator and walk\nnorth, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities. At the beginning of your journey, you would see tropical wet\nforests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator. As you\ncontinued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with\nscattered trees. You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture. At about 30 degrees north, these forests\nwould give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation and high insolation (sunlight).\nMoving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies. Eventually, grasslands are replaced by\ndeciduous temperate forests. These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests and taiga found in the subarctic, the area\nsouth of the Arctic Circle. Finally, you would reach the Arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes. This trek\nnorth reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated\nwith ecosystems found at different latitudes. However, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic\nfactors such as jet streams, the Gulf Stream, and ocean currents. If you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would see\nin the vegetation would parallel in many ways those as you move to higher latitudes.\nEcologists who study biogeography examine patterns ofspecies distribution. No species exists everywhere; for example, the\nVenus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina. Anendemic speciesis one which is\nnaturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size. Other species are generalists: species which\nlive in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon (Procyonspp) for example, is native to most of North and Central America.\nSpecies distribution patternsare based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time\nrequired for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary\nthinking in the eighteenth century. Some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur in regions that have\nbeen physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers. Biologists estimate that Australia, for example, has\nbetween 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals. Approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are\nendemic species found solely in Australia (Figure 44.6ab).\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1287 ---",

As wind (green arrows) pushes\noffshore, it causes water from the ocean bottom (red arrows) to move to the surface, bringing up nutrients from the ocean depths.\nIn freshwater systems, such as lakes, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature and wind changes. The\nnutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fall turnover. Thespring-and-fall turnoverare\nseasonal processes that recycle nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater lake to the top of the lake (Figure 44.10).\nThese turnovers are caused by the formation of athermocline: layers of water with temperatures that are significantly different\nfrom those above and below it.\nIn wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. However, the water under the ice is slightly\nwarmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 \u00b0C to 5 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F to 41 \u00b0F).

These organisms have morphological and physiological adaptations\nto retain water and release solutes into the environment. For example, Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), sneeze\nout water vapor that is high in salt in order to maintain solute concentrations within an acceptable range while swimming\nin the ocean and eating marine plants.\nInorganic Nutrients and Soil\nInorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in determining the distribution and the abundance of\nliving things. Plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots.\nTherefore, soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content together all play an important role\nin the distribution of plants. Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume. Therefore, animal distributions\nare related to the distribution of what they eat. In some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the\nenvironment.\nOther Aquatic Factors\nSome abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments. Terrestrial\nanimals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe. Oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms living at very high elevations,\nhowever, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air. In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved oxygen is\nrelated to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer\nwater. In addition, salinity, currents, and tidal changes can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.\nOther Terrestrial Factors\nWind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation, transpiration, and convective heat loss\nfrom the surface of all organisms. The physical force of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic\nfactors, as well as an ecosystem\u2019s organisms.\nFire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. Some organisms are\nadapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. For example, the jack\npine (Pinus banksiana) requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open (Figure 44.11). Through the burning of pine needles, fire\nadds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth.\nFigure44.11The mature cones of the jack pine(Pinus banksiana)open only when exposed to high temperatures, such as during a forest\nfire. A fire is likely to kill most vegetation, so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely to receive ample sunlight than one that\ngerminates under normal conditions. (credit: USDA)\nAbiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth\nTemperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic\nmatter available as food (net primary productivity).Net primary productivityis an estimation of all of the organic matter\navailable as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular\nrespiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring theabove-ground biomassper\nunit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots (whose mass is very difficult to measure). This means that a\nlarge percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is\nan important variable when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground\n\n--- Page 1292 ---\n1272",

In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved oxygen is\nrelated to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer\nwater. In addition, salinity, currents, and tidal changes can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.\nOther Terrestrial Factors\nWind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation, transpiration, and convective heat loss\nfrom the surface of all organisms. The physical force of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic\nfactors, as well as an ecosystem\u2019s organisms.\nFire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. Some organisms are\nadapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. For"

When one compares the annual temperature variation of\ntropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest\nbecomes apparent. This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and fall)\ngrowth seen in other more temperate biomes. In contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and\nshort days during the yearly cycle. Instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (11\u201312 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation,\nthereby, a longer period of time for plant growth.\nThe annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 cm to 660 cm (50\u2013200 in) with some monthly variation. While\nsunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable. Tropical wet forests typically have wet\nmonths in which there can be more than 30 cm (11\u201312 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10\ncm (3.5 in) of rainfall. However, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds theannualrainfall of some other biomes,\nsuch as deserts.\nTropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas\nare ideal for plant growth. Therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with\nvery high species diversities (Figure 44.13). Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome; on average\nbetween 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of South American Amazonian rain forest. One\nway to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome. On the forest floor is a\nsparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage. A layer of trees rises above\nthis understory and is topped by a closed uppercanopy\u2014the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves. Some additional\ntrees emerge through this closed upper canopy. These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants,\nfungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests.\nFor example,epiphytesare plants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed. Epiphytes are found throughout\ntropical wet forest biomes. Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet\nforests for food and shelter. Some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle.\nFigure44.13Tropical wet forests, such as these forests along the Madre de Dios river, Peru, near the Amazon River, have high species\ndiversity. (credit: Roosevelt Garcia)\nSavannas\nSavannasare grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in Africa, South America, and northern Australia (Figure\n44.12). Savannas are usually hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 \u00b0C to 29 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F to 84 \u00b0F) and an annual\nrainfall of 10\u201340 cm (3.9\u201315.7 in). Savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as well as they\ndo in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes). As a result, within the grasses andforbs(herbaceous flowering plants) that\ndominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (Figure 44.14). Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome,\nplants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly resprout after a fire.\n\n--- Page 1294 ---\n1274",

(credit: Oliver Herold)\nThe trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical wet\nforests because most trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests. The soils of the\ntemperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients. This is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors, which\ndoes not develop in tropical rainforests. As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects\nsoil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly,Armadillidium\nvulgare) and their predators, such as the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus).\nBoreal Forests\nTheboreal forest, also known astaigaor coniferous forest, is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada,\nAlaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 44.12). This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The annual\nprecipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7\u201339 in) and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs because of the\ncold temperatures.\nThe long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing (coniferous) plants.\nThese are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. Evergreen\ntrees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a\nneedle-like leaf than a broad leaf. This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest. In\naddition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and\ndeciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that retain\nnitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.\nThe net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. The above-ground\nbiomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long-lived and accumulate a large standing\nbiomass over time. Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests. Boreal forests lack\nthe pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests. The structure of a boreal forest is often only\na tree layer and a ground layer (Figure 44.19). When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more slowly than broad leaves;\ntherefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth.\n\n--- Page 1298 ---\n1278",

The aquatic medium\u2014water\u2014 has different\nphysical and chemical properties than air, however. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are\nno suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. As one descends into a deep body of water, there will eventually be a\ndepth which the sunlight cannot reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might\nobscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features of the environment. The importance of\nlight in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. In\nfreshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the\nenergy aspects of light. The thermal properties of water (rates of heating and cooling and the ability to store much larger\namounts of energy than the air) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and\nweather patterns. Marine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less\nimportant in most freshwater lakes.\nThe ocean is categorized by several areas or zones (Figure 44.21). All of the ocean\u2019s open water is referred to as thepelagic realm\n(or zone). Thebenthic realm(or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor.\nWithin the pelagic realm is thephotic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate (approximately 200 m or\n650 ft). At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as theaphotic zone. The majority of the\nocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep (in the Mariana\nTrench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To give some perspective on the depth of\nthis trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep. These realms and zones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure44.21The ocean is divided into different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline.\nIn which of the following regions would you expect to find photosynthetic organisms?\na. the aphotic zone, the neritic zone, the oceanic zone, and the benthic realm\nb. the photic zone, the intertidal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone\nc. the photic zone, the abyssal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone\nd. the pelagic realm, the aphotic zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone\n\n--- Page 1300 ---\n1280",

The abyssal zone (Figure 44.21) is very\ncold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. There are a variety of invertebrates and fishes\nfound in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light. Hydrothermal vents are found\nprimarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from the vents.\nThese chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found in the\nabyssal zone.\nCoral Reefs\nCoral reefsareocean ridgesformed by marine invertebrates, comprising mostly cnidarians and molluscs, living in warm\nshallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean.

This massive\nand ancient reef is located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reef systems are fringing islands,\nwhich are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now\nunderwater. The coral organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium\ncarbonate skeleton. These calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef (Figure 44.23). Corals found\nin shallower waters (at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic\nunicellular algae. The relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters in\nwhich these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow.\nSome corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae; these corals attain energy and\nnutrients using stinging cells called cnidocytes on their tentacles to capture prey.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) video(http://openstax.org/l/marine_biology)to see\nmarine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discuss his research on coral organisms.\nIt is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs. These fishes can feed on coral, thecryptofauna\n(invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated with\nthe coral. In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators, herbivores, and\nplanktivores, which consume planktonic organisms such as bacteria, archaea, algae, and protists floating in the pelagic zone.\nFigure44.23Coral reefs are formed by the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral organisms, which are marine invertebrates in the phylum\n\n--- Page 1302 ---\n1282",

Temperature is an important\nabiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, as we have seen, thermal stratification of lakes\nand ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can\npenetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond.Phytoplankton(algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out\nphotosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds.Zooplankton, such as rotifers and larvae and adult\ncrustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead\norganisms that sink to the bottom.\nNitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are the determining factors\nin the amount of phytoplankton growth that takes place in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and\nphosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in\na large accumulation of algae called analgal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light\npenetration in water. They may also release toxic byproducts into the water, contaminating any drinking water taken from that\nsource. In addition, the lake or pond becomes aphotic, and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and\ndecompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to\ndie, resulting in a dead zone. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus\ncontrol and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.\nFigure44.24The uncontrolled growth of algae in this lake has resulted in an algal bloom.

The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon River in South America, and the Mississippi River\nin North America.\nAbiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a point of origin referred to\nassource water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. Thechannel(the width of the river or stream) is\nnarrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Because of this, the current is often faster here than at\nany other point of the river or stream.\nThe fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is usually\nclear and free of debris. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits\nthe growth of phytoplankton. An additional input of energy can come from leaves and other organic material that fall\ndownstream into the river or stream, as well as from trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose,\nthe organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving\nwater. For instance, leeches (phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on the anterior and ventral areas of the body.\nThese suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place, and are also used to attach to their prey. Freshwater\ntrout species (phylum Chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and streams.\nAs the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows.

This slow-\nmoving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation.\n\n--- Page 1304 ---\n1284"

The climate of a biome is characterized\nby having consistent seasonal temperature and rainfall ranges. Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one\nparticular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. In contrast,weatherrefers to the\nconditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles. Long-range\nweather forecasts are available but can be unreliable.\nTo better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern\nWisconsin. You would be thinking aboutclimatewhen you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because you\nhave long-term knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August would be a better choice for an outdoor event\nin Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January. However, you cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held\non because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day. Climate can be considered \u201caverage\u201d weather that\ntakes place over many years.\nGlobal Climate Change\nClimate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study:\n\u2022 evidence of current and past global climate change\n\u2022 drivers of global climate change\n\u2022 documented results of climate change\nIt is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media reports about\nglobal climate change. We should note that it is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the\ndata showing that Earth\u2019s climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change.\nEvidence for Global Climate Change\nSince scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation,\nthey must instead indirectly measure temperature. To do this, scientists rely onhistorical evidence of Earth\u2019s past climate.\nAntarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence for climate change. These ice cores are samples ofpolar iceobtained by\nmeans of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers. Viewing the ice cores is like traveling\nbackwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period. Trapped within the ice are air bubbles and other\nbiological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data. Antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to\nindirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the past 400,000 years (Figure 44.26a). The 0 \u00b0C on this graph refers to the\nlong-term average. Temperatures that are greater than 0 \u00b0C exceed Earth\u2019s long-term average temperature. Conversely,\ntemperatures that are less than 0 \u00b0C are less than Earth\u2019s average temperature. This figure shows that there have been periodic\ncycles of increasing and decreasing temperature.\n\n--- Page 1306 ---\n1286",

By measuring the amount of CO2trapped in the ice, scientists have determined past atmospheric CO2concentrations.\nTemperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount ofdeuterium(a nonradioactive isotope of hydrogen) present.\nFigure 44.27a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth\u2019s temperature during the\nlast 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past. Two significant temperature\nanomalies, orirregularities, have occurred in the last 2,000 years. These are theMedieval Climate Anomaly(or the Medieval\nWarm Period) and theLittle Ice Age. A third temperature anomaly aligns with theIndustrial Era. The Medieval Climate Anomaly\noccurred between 900 and 1300 AD. During this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather\nconditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 \u00b0C and 0.20\n\u00b0C above the norm. Although 0.10 \u00b0C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free seas of ice.\nBecause of this warming, the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland.\nTheLittle Ice Agewas a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD. During this time, a slight cooling of a little less\nthan 1 \u00b0C was observed in North America, Europe, and possibly other areas of the Earth. This 1 \u00b0C change in global temperature\nis a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly); however, it also resulted\nin noticeable climatic changes. Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost.\nTheIndustrial Revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society. Advances in\nagriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States. New\ntechnologies were invented that provided jobs and cheaper goods. These new technologies were powered using fossil fuels,\nespecially coal. The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the Industrial Era.\nWhen a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide is released. With the beginning of the Industrial Era, atmospheric carbon dioxide\nbegan to rise (Figure 44.28).\n\n--- Page 1308 ---\n1288",

The atmospheric carbon\ndioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and a\nhigh of 300 ppm. Scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to increase\nfrom its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration. However, beginning only a few centuries ago,\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm. The current increases\nin atmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quickly\u2014in a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years.\nWhat is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide? A key factor that must\nbe recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence and industrial activities of modern\nhuman society; no other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levelsat this rate or to this\nmagnitude.\nHuman activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in\nseveral ways. The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and\nnatural gas (Figure 44.29). Deforestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of\nforests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide. Methane (CH ) is produced when bacteria break down organic\n4\nmatter under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in\nrice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores. Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition of\nanimal and plant material that occurs in landfills. Another source of methane is the melting ofclathrates.Clathratesare frozen\nchunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean. When water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is\nreleased. As the ocean\u2019s water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more\nmethane. This leads to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming. This\nis an example of the positive feedback loop that is leading to the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures.\nFigure44.29The burning of fossil fuels in industry and by vehicles releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the\natmosphere.

Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and\npopulations fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural\ndisasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within\nspecies. The statistical study of population dynamics,demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to\ninvestigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments. Many of these\ntools were originally designed to study human populations. For example,life tables, which detail the life\nexpectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set\ninsurance rates. In fact, while the term \u201cdemographics\u201d is commonly used when discussing humans, all\nliving populations can be studied using this approach.\nPopulation Size and Density\nThe study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species\nexist, and how closely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be\ncharacterized by itspopulation size (N), the total number of individuals, and itspopulation density, the\nnumber of individuals within a specific area or volume. Population size and density are the two main\ncharacteristics used to describe and understand populations.

However, this\nmethod is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually study\npopulations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a\nwhole. A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density. For immobile organisms\nsuch as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, aquadratmay be used (Figure 45.3). A quadrat is a way of marking\noff square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal\nsquare placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their\nboundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations to estimate the\npopulation size and density within the entire habitat. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of\norganisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism. For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2\nquadrat might be used. With giant redwoods, on the other hand, a larger quadrat of 100 m2might be employed. This ensures\nthat enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not\nsampled.\nFigure45.3A scientist uses a quadrat to measure population size and density. (credit: NPS Sonoran Desert Network)\nFor mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, scientists use a technique calledmark and recapture. This method\ninvolves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then\nreleasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population. Later, researchers collect a new\nsample, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked (Figure 45.4).\nFigure45.4Mark and recapture is used to measure the population size of mobile animals such as (a) bighorn sheep, (b) the California\ncondor, and (c) salmon. (credit a: modification of work by Neal Herbert, NPS; credit b: modification of work by Pacific Southwest Region\nUSFWS; credit c: modification of work by Ingrid Taylar)\nUsing the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. From this,\ncalculations are used to estimate the total population size. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the\npercentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals.

Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death\nrates, and life expectancies. Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics\ndescribed above. For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive\nindividuals are present. In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition,\ndisease, and the accumulation of waste. Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more\npotential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio (the ratio\nof males to females) orage structure(the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of many\nindividuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.\nIn addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time. If\nbirth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. However, the population size will increase if birth rates exceed\ndeath rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. Life expectancy is another important factor; the\nlength of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health of the\npopulation. These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.\nLife Tables\nLife tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. Life tables divide the population into age\ngroups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. They are modeled after actuarial tables used\nby the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying\nbefore their next birthday (i.e., theirmortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval,\nand their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown inTable 45.1from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a\nspecies native to northwestern North America. Notice that the population is divided into age intervals (column A). The mortality\nrate (per 1000), shown in column D, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval (column B) divided by\nthe number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C), multiplied by 1000.\nFor example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000 sheep.\nThis number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand.\nAs can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12\nmonths old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors.

Life history traits affect the life table of an organism. A species\u2019 life history is genetically\ndetermined and shaped by the environment and natural selection.\nLife History Patterns and Energy Budgets\nEnergy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is often a\nmajor limiting factor in determining an organism\u2019s survival. Plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via\nphotosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next\ngeneration. Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food. Furthermore, some\nanimals must expend energy caring for their offspring. Thus, all species have anenergy budget: they must balance energy intake\nwith their use of energy for metabolism, reproduction, parental care, and energy storage (such as bears building up body fat for\nwinter hibernation).\nParental Care and Fecundity\nFecundityis the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population. In other words, fecundity describes how\nmany offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive cycle as\nsoon as possible after the birth of the offspring. In animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental care given to\nan individual offspring. Species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually provide little if any\ncare for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway). Most of their energy budget is used to\nproduce many tiny offspring. Animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a very early age. This is because of the energy\ntradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness. Because their energy is used for producing\noffspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be able to move within their\nenvironment and find food and perhaps shelter. Even with these abilities, their small size makes them extremely vulnerable to\npredation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain the species.\nAnimal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of their\nenergy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health. This is the case with many mammals, such as\nhumans, kangaroos, and pandas.

Some of this work has been done using the common fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster. Studies\nhave shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have\nalready mated several times have limited sperm remaining for reproduction. Fruit flies maximize their last chances at\nreproduction by selecting optimal mates.\nIn a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. The males that mated with\nvirgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number of inseminated females with which they were\nunable to mate. This effect occurred regardless of how large (indicative of their age) the males were. Thus, males that did not\nmate lived longer, allowing them more opportunities to find mates in the future.\nMore recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and how this is affected by\nprevious matings (Figure 45.8).2Males were allowed to select between smaller and larger females. Findings showed that larger\nfemales had greater fecundity, producing twice as many offspring per mating as the smaller females did. Males that had\npreviously mated, and thus had lower supplies of sperm, were termed \u201cresource-depleted,\u201d while males that had not mated were\ntermed \u201cnon-resource-depleted.\u201d The study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with larger\nfemales, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. Thus, males with depleted sperm\nsupplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before they replenished their sperm supply, selected\nlarger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances for offspring. This study was one of the first to show that the\nphysiological state of the male affected its mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive\nresources.\nFigure45.8Male fruit flies that had previously mated (sperm-depleted) picked larger, more fecund females more often than those that had\nnot mated (non-sperm-depleted). This change in behavior causes an increase in the efficiency of a limited reproductive resource: sperm.\nThese studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction. First, energy expended on mating\nmay reduce an animal\u2019s lifespan, but by this time they have already reproduced, so in the context of natural selection this early\ndeath is not of much evolutionary importance. Second, when resources such as sperm (and the energy needed to replenish it)\nare low, an organism\u2019s behavior can change to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. These\nchanges in behavior, so important to evolution, are studied in a discipline known as behavioral biology, or ethology, at the\ninterface between population biology and psychology.",

In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as resources become scarce, and it levels\noff when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, resulting in an S-shaped curve.\nLogistic Growth\nExponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles\nDarwin recognized this fact in his description of the \u201cstruggle for existence,\u201d which states that individuals will compete (with\nmembers of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on their own\ncharacteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural\nselection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed thelogistic growthmodel.\nCarrying Capacity and the Logistic Model\nIn the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in\nenvironments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough,\nresources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure 45.9). This\npopulation size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the\ncarrying capacity, orK.\nThe formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The\nexpression \u201cK\u2013N\u201d indicates how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and \u201cK\u2013N\u201d divided by \u201cK\u201d is\nthe fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor\nto generate the logistic growth equation:\nNotice that whenNis very small, (K-N)/Kbecomes close toK/Kor 1, and the right side of the equation reduces tor N, which\nmax\nmeans the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity. On the other hand, whenNis large,\n(K-N)/Kcomes close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped. Thus, population\ngrowth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacityK. This model also allows for the population of a negative\npopulation growth, or a population decline. This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying\ncapacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative).\nA graph of this equation yields anS-shaped curve(Figure 45.9), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than\nexponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are\nfew individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally,\ngrowth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.\nRole of Intraspecific Competition\nThe logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal\nchance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources,\nwhereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.\n\n--- Page 1326 ---\n1306",

A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively\nresponsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures.7In addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of\nhabitat, these scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of humans\nacross the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago.\nThe maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. It is\nimportant to remember that humans are also part of nature. We once contributed to a species\u2019 decline using only primitive\nhunting technology.\nLife Histories ofK-selected andr-selected Species\nWhile reproductive strategies play a key role in life histories, they do not account for important factors like limited resources\nand competition. The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in population\nbiology, that ofK-selected versusr-selected species.\nThe concept relates to a species\u2019 reproductive strategies, habitat, and behavior, especially in the way that they obtain resources\nand care for their young. It includes length of life and survivorship factors as well. Population biologists have grouped species\ninto the two large categories\u2014K-selected andr-selected\u2014although the categories are really two ends of a continuum.\nK-selected speciesare species selected by stable, predictable environments. Populations ofK-selected species tend to exist close\nto their carrying capacity (hence the termK-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. These species have few, large\noffspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table 45.2). While larger in size when born,\nthe offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth. By the time they reach adulthood, they must develop skills to\ncompete for natural resources. In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes to develop or how\nlong it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. Examples ofK-selected species\nare primates (including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (Figure 45.13a).\nOak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. As many as 50,000\nacorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals such\nas squirrels. In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a two- or\nthree-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection).\nAs oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage of their\nenergy budget to growth and maintenance. The tree\u2019s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the competition for\nsunlight, the oak\u2019s primary energy resource. Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large, energy-rich seeds\nthat use their energy reserve to become quickly established (K-selection).\nIn contrast,r-selected specieshave a large number of small offspring (hence theirrdesignation (Table 45.2)). This strategy is\noften employed in unpredictable or changing environments. Animals that arer-selected do not give long-term parental care and\nthe offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. Examples ofr-selected species are marine invertebrates, such as\njellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (Figure 45.13b). Dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances.\nMany seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment. Seeds that land\nin inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content. Note that survival is not\nnecessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.\n6David Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo et al., \u201cClimate Change, Humans, and the Extinction of the Woolly Mammoth.\u201dPLoS Biol6 (April 2008): e79, doi:10.1371/\njournal.pbio.0060079.\n7G.M.

Earth\u2019s human population is growing rapidly, to the extent\nthat some worry about the ability of the earth\u2019s environment to sustain this population. Long-term exponential growth carries\nthe potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death.\nAlthough humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this\ntransformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earth\u2019s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may\nbe in danger of collapse. The depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate change are\ncaused by human activities. The ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown. As some point out, it is\nlikely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive ones\u2014the world\u2019s carrying capacity for\nhuman beings might actually decrease.\nThe human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below its biotic\npotential (Figure 45.14). To reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine months or so during\ntheir reproductive years. Also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support such growth. Neither of\nthese two conditions exists. In spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially.\nFigure45.14Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential (dark blue line). Notice that while the population in Asia (yellow line),\nwhich has many economically underdeveloped countries, is increasing exponentially, the population in Europe (light blue line), where most\nof the countries are economically developed, is growing much more slowly.\nA consequence of exponential human population growth is a reduction in time that it takes to add a particular number of\nhumans to the Earth.Figure 45.15shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only took 24 years\nto add two billion people between 1975 and 1999. As already discussed, our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely\nmy be limited. Without new technological advances, the human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades.\nHowever, the population will still be increasing and the threat of overpopulation remains.\n\n--- Page 1332 ---\n1312",

Ehrlich wrote, \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s\nhundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing\ncan prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.\u201d8While many experts view this statement as incorrect based on\nevidence, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot\ncontinue indefinitely.\nSeveral nations have instituted policies aimed at influencing population. Efforts to control population growth led to theone-\nchild policyin China, which is now being phased out. India also implements national and regional populations to encourage\nfamily planning. On the other hand, Japan, Spain, Russia, Iran, and other countries have made efforts to increase population\n8Paul R.

In most cases, numerous species share a habitat.\nThe interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth and abundance. All populations\noccupying the same habitat form a community: populations inhabiting a specific area at the same time. The number of species\noccupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity. Areas with low diversity, such as the\nglaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it\ncannot be counted. Ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete\nfor the same resources.\nPredation and Herbivory\nPerhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the consumption of prey by its predator. Nature shows on\ntelevision highlight the drama of one living organism killing another. Populations of predators and prey in a community are not\nconstant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related. The most often cited example of predator-prey\ndynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old trapping data\nfrom North American forests (Figure 45.18). This cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years, with the predator\npopulation lagging 1\u20132 years behind that of the prey population. As the hare numbers increase, there is more food available for\nthe lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. When the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill\nso many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food.\nWhen the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at least in part, to low predation pressure,\nstarting the cycle anew.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1335 ---",

Predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms will\nexperience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future. This type of defensive\nmechanism is calledaposematic coloration, or warning coloration (Figure 45.21).\nFigure45.21(a) The strawberry poison dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators that it is toxic, while the\n(b) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the unpleasant odor it produces. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Jay Iwasaki; credit b: modification of work by Dan Dzurisin)\nWhile some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved\nmechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain\ntoxic chemicals. InBatesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one. Assuming they\nshare the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the same level of\nphysical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic. Many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps\nor bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation (Figure 45.22).\nFigure45.22Batesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species mimics the coloration of a harmful species, as is seen with the (a)\nbumblebee and (b) bee-like robber fly. (credit a, b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nInM\u00fcllerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses.Figure 45.23\nshows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration. InEmsleyan/Mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey mimics a\nless dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the nonvenomous milk snake. This type of mimicry is\nextremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types. For this type of mimicry to work, it is essential that\neating the milk snake has unpleasant but not fatal consequences. Then, these predators learn not to eat snakes with this\ncoloration, protecting the coral snake as well. If the snake were fatal to the predator, there would be no opportunity for the\npredator to learn not to eat it, and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear.\n\n--- Page 1338 ---\n1318",

The two organisms are then said to occupy different microniches.\nThese organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition.\nSymbiosis\nSymbiotic relationships, orsymbioses(plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended\nperiod of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations. Most scientists accept this\ndefinition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the\ninteraction. In this discussion, the broader definition will be used.\nCommensalism\nAcommensalrelationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither\nbenefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 45.25). The tree is not\nharmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of\nthe branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are\nunaffected.

The tapeworm can\nlive inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host is eating, and may grow to be over 50 ft\nlong by adding segments. The parasite moves from species to species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life\ncycle.\nAnother common parasite isPlasmodium falciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the\nworld. Living in human liver and red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to\ncomplete its life cycle. Thus malaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious\ndiseases.\nFigure45.27This diagram shows the life cycle of a pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), a human worm parasite.

Kelp, or brown algae, is a\nfoundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.\nFoundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other organisms\nthat use them. An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef (Figure 45.28). Corals themselves are not photosynthetic,\nbut harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform photosynthesis; this is\nanother example of a mutualism.

Birds fly south for the winter to get to\nwarmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds. The popular 2005 documentaryMarch of\nthe Penguinsfollowed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site\nand to their young. Wildebeests (Figure 45.35) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands.\nFigure45.35Wildebeests migrate in a clockwise fashion over 1800 miles each year in search of rain-ripened grass. (credit: Eric Inafuku)\nAlthough migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration). Animals\nthat exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not. Additionally, in some animals, only a portion of the population\nmigrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration). For example, owls that live in the tundra may migrate in\nyears when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when rodents are plentiful.\nForaging\nForagingis the act of searching for and exploiting food resources. Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize\nenergy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section. The painted stork, for\nexample, uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for crabs and other food (Figure 45.36).\nFigure45.36The painted stork uses its long beak to forage. (credit: J.M. Garg)\nInnate Behaviors: Living in Groups\nNot all animals live in groups, but even those that live relatively solitary lives, with the exception of those that can reproduce\nasexually, must mate. Mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the desire to mate. There are\nseveral types of energy-intensive behaviors or displays associated with mating, called mating rituals. Other behaviors found in\npopulations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal benefits from the behavior. In selfish behavior, only the\nanimal in question benefits; in altruistic behavior, one animal\u2019s actions benefit another animal; cooperative behavior describes\nwhen both animals benefit. All of these behaviors involve some sort of communication between population members.\nCommunication within a Species\nAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known assignals. An example of this is seen in the three-spined\nstickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals\nfemales to mate.

Examples\nof such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom. Social insects such as worker bees have no ability to reproduce, yet\nthey maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring. Meerkats keep a sentry standing guard to warn the rest\nof the colony about intruders, even though the sentry is putting itself at risk. Wolves and wild dogs bring meat to pack members\nnot present during a hunt. Lemurs take care of infants unrelated to them. Although on the surface, these behaviors appear to be\naltruistic, the truth may not be so simple.\nThere has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist. Do these behaviors lead to overall evolutionary advantages\nfor their species? Do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes? And what about such activities between unrelated\nindividuals? One explanation for altruistic-type behaviors is found in the genetics of natural selection. In the 1976 book,The\nSelfish Gene,scientist Richard Dawkins attempted to explain many seemingly altruistic behaviors from the viewpoint of the\ngene itself. Although a gene obviously cannot be selfish in the human sense, it may appear that way if the sacrifice of an\nindividual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives because of common\nlineage). Mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring. Emperor penguins migrate miles in harsh\nconditions to bring food back for their young. Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and is still discussed\namong scientists in related fields.\nEven less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from seemingly\naltruistic behavior. The activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples. Sterile workers in\nthese societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring, she is passing on\ngenes from the workers indirectly. Thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct\nchance of passing on its genes due to its sterility. The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a\nrelative and thus one\u2019s inclusive fitness evolves throughkin selection. This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic\nbehaviors seen in animals. However, these behaviors may not be truly defined as altruism in these cases because the actor is\nactually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or indirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains\nthrough relatives that share genes with it).\nUnrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the \u201cselfish gene\u201d explanation. An example\nof this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that individual\npick the parasites from its fur. After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now grooms the\nsecond monkey. Thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior. Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness is raised more than\nif neither cooperated nor if one cooperated and the other did not cooperate. This behavior is still not necessarily altruism, as the\n\u201cgiving\u201d behavior of the actor is based on the expectation that it will be the \u201creceiver\u201d of the behavior in the future, termed\nreciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each other, often the result of living in\nthe same social group, and that cheaters (those that never \u201cgive back\u201d) are punished.\nEvolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called\n\u201caltruistic behaviors\u201d are not altruistic at all. The definition of \u201cpure\u201d altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that\nbenefits another without any direct benefit to oneself. Most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this\ndefinition, and game theorists are good at finding \u201cselfish\u201d components in them. Others have argued that the terms \u201cselfish\u201d and\n\u201caltruistic\u201d should be dropped completely when discussing animal behavior, as they describe human behavior and may not be\ndirectly applicable to instinctual animal activity. What is clear, though, is that heritable behaviors that improve the chances of\npassing on one\u2019s genes or a portion of one\u2019s genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future generations as\nlong as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage. These instinctual behaviors may then be applied, in special circumstances, to\nother species, as long as it doesn\u2019t lower the animal\u2019s fitness.\nFinding Sex Partners\nNot all animals reproduce sexually, but many that do have the same challenge: they need to find a suitable mate and often have\nto compete with other individuals to obtain one. Significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and mating\nwith the sex partner. Two types of selection occur during this process:intersexual selection, where individuals of one sex choose\nmates of the other sex, andintrasexual selection, the competition for mates between species members of the same sex.\nIntersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual, aural, tactile, and chemical\n\n--- Page 1350 ---\n1330",

They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from the environment.\nConversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism to adapt to changes in the\nenvironment and are modified by previous experiences. Simple learned behaviors include habituation and imprinting\u2014both are\nimportant to the maturation process of young animals.\nHabituation\nHabituationis a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure.\nThis is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward. Prairie dogs\ntypically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human footsteps when\nno harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call. In this example,\nhabituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential predators.\nImprinting\nImprintingis a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species\ninvolved. Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her. A familiar sight is\nducklings walking or swimming after their mothers (Figure 45.39). This is another type of non-associative learning, but is very\nimportant in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so they will be protected,\ngreatly increasing their chances of survival. However, if newborn ducks see a human before they see their mother, they will\nimprint on the human and follow it in just the same manner as they would follow their real mother.\nFigure45.39The attachment of ducklings to their mother is an example of imprinting.

The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov\u2019s experiments with dogs (Figure 45.40).\nIn Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned stimulus of\nseeing or smelling their food.

In fact, that is how students are learning right now by reading this book. As students read, they can\nmake mental images of objects or organisms and imagine changes to them, or behaviors by them, and anticipate the\nconsequences. In addition to visual processing, cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past experiences, touching\nphysical objects, hearing sounds, tasting food, and a variety of other sensory-based inputs. Cognitive learning is so powerful\nthat it can be used to understand conditioning in detail. In the reverse scenario, conditioning cannot help someone learn about\ncognition.\nClassic work on cognitive learning was done by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler with chimpanzees. He demonstrated that these animals were\ncapable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle. When a banana was hung in their cage too\nhigh for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack the boxes\none on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana. This implies that they could visualize the result of stacking the\nboxes even before they had performed the action. This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile than conditioning.\nCognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it. Maze running experiments done\nwith rats by H.C. Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal. The motivation for the\nanimals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end. In these studies, the animals in Group I were run in\none trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run (Figure 45.42). Group II rats were not fed in\nthe maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after. Group III rats had food\navailable on the third day and every day thereafter. The results were that the control rats, Group I, learned quickly, and figured\nout how to run the maze in seven days. Group III did not learn much during the three days without food, but rapidly caught up\nto the control group when given the food reward. Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no reward to motivate them,\nand they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it took two days longer to learn the\nmaze.\nFigure45.42Group I (the green solid line) found food at the end of each trial, group II (the blue dashed line) did not find food for the first 6\ndays, and group III (the red dotted line) did not find food during runs on the first three days. Notice that rats given food earlier learned\nfaster and eventually caught up to the control group. The orange dots on the group II and III lines show the days when food rewards were\nadded to the mazes.\nIt may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning. Although one might be tempted to\nbelieve that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, E.C.

It is difficult to quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat, especially\nwhen studying large habitats such as the Amazon Rainforest.\nFor these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions.

A major limitation to these\napproaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through\npartitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. These changes are often due to differences in species numbers and\ndiversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or recreating (microcosm) the natural habitat.\nThus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem from which they were\ngathered.\nAs both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems should\nbe used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem structure,\nfunction, and dynamics.\nScientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure\nand dynamics of ecosystems.

Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often in the\nform of adenosine triphosphate, ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller compounds, and\nlife itself is an energy-driven process. Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic\nacids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input.\nIt is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to another\nthrough food webs and their constituent food chains. Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems,\nincluding how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the food web.\nHow Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web\nEnergy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of other\nliving or previously living organisms by heterotrophs.\nPhotosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable of\nsynthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). Photosynthetic\nautotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use\ninorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems. Without these organisms, energy would not\nbe available to other living organisms and life itself would not be possible.\nPhotoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the world\u2019s\necosystems. These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs. Photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the sun by\nconverting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP). The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize complex organic\nmolecules, such as glucose.\nChemoautotrophsare primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in those\nassociated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (Figure 46.9). Many chemoautotrophs in\nhydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy. This allows\n2\nchemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies energy to\nthe rest of the ecosystem.\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n--- Page 1371 ---",

As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic bacteria and organic material that sinks\nfrom the ocean\u2019s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summit of this highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface.\nProductivity within Trophic Levels\nProductivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass\nin a particular trophic level.Biomassis the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or previously living\norganisms within a trophic level. Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level. For example, in the\nEnglish Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2(grams per square meter), while the primary\nconsumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2.\nThe productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to\nother living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy. The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers\nincorporate energy from the sun is calledgross primary productivity. An example of gross primary productivity is shown in the\ncompartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (Figure 46.8). In this ecosystem, the\ntotal energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810 kcal/m2/yr.\nBecause all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss)\nscientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem.Net primary productivityis the energy that remains in\nthe primary producers after accounting for the organisms\u2019 respiration and heat loss. The net productivity is then available to the\nprimary consumers at the next trophic level. In our Silver Springs example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr were used for\nrespiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,633 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers.\nEcological Efficiency: The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels\nAs illustrated in (Figure 46.8), as energy flows from primary producers through the various trophic levels, the ecosystem loses\nlarge amounts of energy. The main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy\nis converted from one form to another, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system. In biologic systems, this\nenergy takes the form of metabolic heat, which is lost when the organisms consume other organisms. In the Silver Springs\necosystem example (Figure 46.8), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of\nenergy available to them from the primary producers. The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive\ntrophic levels is termed thetrophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE)and is defined by the formula:\nIn Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent.

The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary consumers, thus,\nminimizing their biomass at any particular point in time. However, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus they are able to\nsupport the rest of the ecosystem.\nPyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels. Notice that these numbers are the\nsame as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in (Figure 46.8). Pyramids of energy are always upright, and an\necosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported. All types of ecological pyramids are useful for\ncharacterizing ecosystem structure. However, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are the\nmost consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure (Figure 46.10).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure46.10Ecological pyramids depict the (a) biomass, (b) number of organisms, and (c) energy in each trophic level.\nPyramids depicting the number of organisms or biomass may be inverted, upright, or even diamond-shaped. Energy pyramids,\nhowever, are always upright. Why?\nConsequences of Food Webs: Biological Magnification\nOne of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification.Biomagnificationis the\nincreasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers to the\napex consumers. Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including the pesticidedichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane\n(DDT), which was described in the 1960s bestseller,Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson. DDT was a commonly used pesticide before\nits dangers became known. In some aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms of the\nlower level, which caused DDT to increase in birds (apex consumers) that ate fish. Thus, the birds accumulated sufficient\namounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells. This effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was shown to have\nadverse effects on these bird populations. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in the 1970s.\nOther substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were used in coolant liquids in the United States\nuntil their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. These substances were best studied\n\n--- Page 1374 ---\n1354",

The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The\nexchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location, and\neach one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO ) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines with water\n2\nmolecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Figure 46.16)\nFigure46.16Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions.\nThe equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions. Some of\nthese ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (CaCO), a major component of marine organism shells.\n3\nThese organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone,\nwhich comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.\nOn land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering of\nterrestrial rock and minerals. This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff. Deeper underground, on\nland and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels\nare considered a nonrenewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. Anonrenewable resource, such\nas fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land\n(including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments\nfrom the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process ofsubduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath\nanother. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents.\nHumans contribute to atmospheric carbon by the burning of fossil fuels and other materials. Since the Industrial Revolution,\nhumans have significantly increased the release of carbon and carbon compounds, which has in turn affected the climate and\noverall environment.\nAnimal husbandry by humans also increases atmospheric carbon. The large numbers of land animals raised to feed the Earth\u2019s\ngrowing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to farming practices and respiration and\nmethane production. This is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant\nway. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on\nfossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and respiration, into account as they model and predict the\nfuture impact of this increase.\nThe Nitrogen Cycle\nGetting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the\natmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N ) even though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent\n2\nof the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their\nmacromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N ). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is\n2\npresent; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to \u201cfix\u201d nitrogen.\nRhizobiumbacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with\nthe organic nitrogen they need. (For example, gardeners often grow peas both for their produce and to naturally add nitrogen to\nthe soil. This practice goes back to ancient times, even if the science has only been recently understood.) Free-living bacteria,\nsuch asAzotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers.\nOrganic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary\nproduction and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen.

Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for\ngrowth) in aquatic ecosystems (Figure 46.18).\nPhosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO 3\u2212). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural\n4\nsurface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers,\nlakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the\nbodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may\nalso be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of areas of the\nEarth\u2019s surface.\nPhosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems.

In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first ecosystems to have identified dead zones,\nwhich continue to kill many fish and bottom-dwelling species, such as clams, oysters, and worms. Several species have\ndeclined in the Chesapeake Bay due to surface water runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on\nland. The source of the fertilizers (with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There\nare many nearby urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff\nfrom lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of\nindustry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners.\nOf particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster\nreefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000 acres. Oyster harvesting was once a\nmajor industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. This decline was due not only to\nfertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting. Oysters require a certain minimum population density because\nthey must be in close proximity to reproduce. Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly\ndisrupting the ecosystem.\nThe restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. Not\nonly do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters are filter feeders, and as they eat, they\nclean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the\nentire volume of the bay. Today, with changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take\nnearly a year to do the same job.\nRestoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by nonprofit organizations, such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nThe restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many\ndisease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for the College of William and Mary) are\nnow available and have been used in the construction of experimental oyster reefs. Efforts to clean and restore the bay by\nVirginia and Delaware have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which\nstresses the need for interstate cooperation to gain successful restoration.\nThe new, hearty oyster strains have also spawned a new and economically viable industry\u2014oyster aquaculture\u2014which not\nonly supplies oysters for food and profit, but also has the added benefit of cleaning the bay.\nThe Sulfur Cycle\nSulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things. As a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved in the\nformation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-D folding patterns, and hence their functions. As\nshown inFigure 46.21, sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of\nsulfur dioxide (SO ) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules, from volcanic\n2\nactivity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.\n\n--- Page 1384 ---\n1364",

These estimation\nindices, which came frominformation theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity\nbetween and within ecosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists\nis simply the loss of biodiversity. However, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of\nspecies diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve the biologically or technologically important elements of\nbiodiversity.\nThe Lake Victoria cichlids provide an example with which we can begin to understand biodiversity. The\nbiologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of\nspecializations to specialized habitat types and specific feeding strategies: such as eating plankton floating\nin the water, scraping/eating algae from rocks, eating insect larvae from the lake bottom, and eating the\neggs of other species of cichlid. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are the product of an complexadaptive\nradiation. Anadaptive radiationis a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the Lake Victoria\ncichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic clade into many closely related species. Typically,\nthe species \u201cradiate\u201d into different habitats and niches. The Gal\u00e1pagos Island finches are an example of a\nmodest adaptive radiation with 15 species. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are an example of a spectacular\nadaptive radiation that formerly included about 500 species.\nAt the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear. A culprit in\nthese declines was the Nile perch, a species of large predatory fish that was introduced to Lake Victoria by\nfisheries to feed the people living around the lake. The Nile perch was introduced in 1963, but its populations\ndid not begin to surge until the 1980s. The perch population grew by consuming cichlids, driving species\nafter species to the point ofextinction(the disappearance of a species). In fact, there were several factors\nthat played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria: the Nile perch, declining\nlake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria, and increased fishing\npressure. Scientists had not even catalogued all of the species present\u2014so many were lost that were never\nnamed. The diversity is now a shadow of what it once was.\nThe cichlids of Lake Victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over\nEarth that is caused primarily by human activity. Extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that\noccurs at the rate of about one out of 1 million species becoming extinct per year. The fossil record reveals\nthat there have been five periods ofmass extinctionin history with much higher rates of species loss, and\nthe rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of mass extinction. However, there is a major\ndifference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction we are experiencing: human\nactivity. Specifically, three human activities have a major impact: 1) destruction of habitat, 2) introduction of\nexotic species, and 3) over-harvesting. Predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of\ntime on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent.

A species\u2019 future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of\nthe individuals in populations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very\ndifferent types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that are genetically similar and have similar\necologies. If there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for\nsubsequent evolution is the mostgenetically diverseone.\nMany genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing.\nGenetic diversity can be measured aschemical diversityin that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells,\nboth the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. This chemical diversity has potential benefit for\nhumans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and\nwelfare.\nHumans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi, among many other organisms. This diversity is also\nsuffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in densely populated\nregions such as China, India, and Japan. The human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its\ndecline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists.\nIt is also useful to defineecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or within a given\ngeographic area (Figure 47.2). Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other\necosystems. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of\ncoadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct\necosystem in North America is theprairie ecosystem. Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in\nnorthern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl.\nMany of the species survive elsewhere, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most\nproductive agricultural soils in the United States is now gone.

Additionally, therate of\nendemismis highest, and there are more biodiversity \u201chotspots.\u201d However, this richness of diversity also means that knowledge\nof species is unfortunately very low, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss.\nConservation of Biodiversity\nIn 1988, British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at\nsignificant risk for species loss:biodiversity hotspots.Biodiversity hotspotsare geographical areas that contain high numbers\nof endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts, a kind\nof conservation triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species. The original criteria\nfor a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area disturbed by human\nactivity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 47.4) containing large numbers of endemic species, which include half of\nEarth\u2019s endemic plants.\nFigure47.4Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots, which cover only 2.3 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface but have\nendemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world\u2019s plants.\nBiodiversity Change through Geological Time\nThe number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary processes\nthat are continuously ongoing:speciationandextinction. Both are natural \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d processes of macroevolution.\nWhen speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species\nwill decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout Earth\u2019s history, these two processes have\nfluctuated\u2014sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record (Figure\n47.5).\n\n--- Page 1398 ---\n1378",

The main hypothesis for its cause is a period\nof glaciation and then warming. The extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by about 1 million\nyears. The first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming. The climate changes\naffected temperatures and sea levels. Some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a nearby supernova,\nwas a possible cause of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The gamma-ray burst would have stripped away the Earth\u2019s\nprotective ozone layer, allowing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the surface of the earth\u2014andmayaccount for\nclimate changes observed at the time. The hypothesis is very speculative, and extraterrestrial influences on Earth\u2019s history are an\nactive line of research. Recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the\nlocation.\nThelate Devonian extinctionmay have occurred over a relatively long period of time. It appears to have mostly affected marine\nspecies and not so much the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats. The causes of this extinction are poorly\nunderstood.\nTheend-Permian extinctionwas the largest in the history of life. Indeed, an argument could be made that Earth became nearly\ndevoid of life during this extinction event. Estimates are that 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial\nspecies were lost. It was at this time, for example, that the trilobites, a group that survived the Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction,\nbecame extinct. The causes for this mass extinction are not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic\nactivity that led to a runaway global-warming event. The oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life. Terrestrial\ntetrapod diversity took 30 million years to recover after the end-Permian extinction. The Permian extinction dramatically altered\nEarth\u2019s biodiversity makeup and the course of evolution.\nThe causes of theTriassic\u2013Jurassicextinction event are not clear, and researchers argue hypotheses including climate change,\nasteroid impact, and volcanic eruptions. The extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea,\nalthough recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the Triassic.\nThe causes of the end-Cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood. It was during this extinction event\nabout 65 million years ago that the majority of the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared\nfrom the planet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds).\nThe cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large meteorite, or asteroid, off the\ncoast of what is now the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. This hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was a radical explanation based on a sharp\nspike in the levels ofiridium(which enters our atmosphere from meteors at a fairly constant rate but is otherwise absent on\nEarth\u2019s surface) in the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods (Figure 47.6). This\nboundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many other taxa. The researchers who discovered the\niridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the atmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather\nthan a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period. It was a radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately\naged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more believable. Now an abundance of geological evidence supports\nthe theory. Recovery times for biodiversity after the end-Cretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for the end-\nPermian extinction, on the order of 10 million years.\nAnother possibility, perhaps coincidental with the impact of the Yucatan asteroid, was extensive volcanism that began forming\nabout 66 million years ago, about the same time as the Yucatan asteroid impact, at the end of the Cretaceous. The lava flows\ncovered over 50 percent of what is now India.

Since the beginning of the Holocene period, there are numerous recent\nextinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the\nEuropean colonies since the 1500s.\nOne of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The odd pigeon-like bird lived in the forests of Mauritius (an\nisland in the Indian Ocean) and became extinct around 1662. The dodo was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey\nbecause it approached people without fear (the dodo had not evolved with humans). Pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by\nEuropean ships also killed dodo young and eggs.\nSteller's sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the northwest coast of North\nAmerica. Steller's sea cow was first discovered by Europeans in 1741 and was overhunted for meat and oil. The last sea cow was\nkilled in 1768. That amounts to just 27 years between the sea cow\u2019s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the species!\nSince 1900, a variety of species have gone extinct, including the following:\n\u2022 In 1914, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio. This species had once darkened the skies of North\nAmerica during its migrations, but it was overhunted and suffered from habitat loss that resulted from the clearing of\nforests for farmland.\n\u2022 The Carolina parakeet, once common in the eastern United States, died out in 1918. It suffered habitat loss and was hunted\nto prevent it from eating orchard fruit. (The parakeet ate orchard fruit because its native foods were destroyed to make way\nfor farmland.)\n\u2022 The Japanese sea lion, which inhabited a broad area around Japan and the coast of Korea, became extinct in the 1950s due to\nfishermen.\n\u2022 The Caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the Caribbean Sea but was driven to extinction via hunting by 1952.\nThese are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called theRed List. The list is not complete, but it describes 380 extinct\nspecies of vertebrates after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.\nEstimates of Present-Time Extinction Rates\nEstimates ofextinction ratesare hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation. The\nextinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way. But\nthere are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed.\nThebackground extinctionrate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (E/MSY). For example, assuming there\nare about ten million species in existence, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each year\nrepresents ten million species per year).\nOne contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. For birds alone this\nmethod yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY. However, this value may be an underestimate for three reasons. First, many species\nwould not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed. Second, the\nnumber of recently extinct vertebrate species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal\nremains. And third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such.\nTaking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 E/MSY. The predicted rate by the end of the\ncentury is 1500 E/MSY.\nA second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest-\narea loss and understanding species-area relationships. Thespecies-area relationshipis the rate at which new species are seen\nwhen the area surveyed is increased. Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island\nincreases. This phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other island-like habitats as well, such as the mountain-top\ntepuis of Venezuela, which are surrounded by tropical forest. Turning this relationship around, if the habitat area is reduced,\nthe number of species living there will also decline. Estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and species-area\nrelationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would become extinct.\nSpecies-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 E/MSY and higher. In general, actual\nobservations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there is a delay in extinction. Recent work\nhas also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when estimating the loss of species. This work\n\n--- Page 1402 ---\n1382",

But is the loss\npractically important for the welfare of the human species? From the perspective of evolution and ecology, the loss of a\nparticular individual species is unimportant (however, we should note that the loss of a keystone species can lead to ecological\ndisaster). Extinction is a normal part of macroevolution. But theaccelerated extinction ratetranslates into the loss of tens of\nthousands of species within our lifetimes, and it is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of\necosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health.\nAgriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate\nenvironment. This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living\nthings on the planet. Biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as\nevery other species on the planet is dependent. Technology smooths out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human\nspecies cannot exist without a supportive ecosystem.\nHuman Health\nArcheological evidence indicates that humans have been using plants for medicinal uses for thousands of years. A Chinese\ndocument from approximately 2800 BC is believed to be the the first written account of herbal remedies, and such references\noccur throughout the global historical record. Contemporary indigenous societies that live close to the land often retain broad\nknowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. Most plants producesecondary plant compounds, which are\ntoxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication.\nModern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds.

Many medicines were\nonce derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs\ncontained at least one plant extract. That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are\nreplaced by synthetic versions. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in\ndeveloped countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.\nFigure47.8Catharanthus roseus, the Madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties. Among other uses, it is a source of\nvincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas. (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)\nIn recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential. By 2007, the FDA had\napproved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes. Another five\ndrugs are undergoing clinical trials, and at least six drugs are being used in other countries. Other toxins under investigation\ncome from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions.\nAside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medicines improve people\u2019s lives. Pharmaceutical companies are\nalways looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as medicines. It is estimated that 1/3 of\npharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to\nmarket between 1981 and 2002 were derived from natural compounds. The opportunities for new medications will be reduced in\ndirect proportion to the disappearance of species.\nAgricultural Diversity\nSince the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop\nvarieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example, potatoes\nwere domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The potatoes grown in that region\nbelong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. Even the Inca capital of Machu Picchu had\nnumerous gardens growing varieties of potatoes. Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and\nclimate conditions. The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the topography, the limited movement of people, and the\ndemands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields.\nPotatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by\nhumans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value,\nadaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests.\nThe potato also demonstrates risks of low crop diversity. The tragic Irish potato famine occurred when the single variety grown\nin Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight, wiping out the entire crop. The loss of the potato crop led to mass famine and\nthe related deaths of over one million people, as well as mass emigration of nearly two million people.\nDisease resistance is a chief benefit of crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks.\nSeed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to\nkeep up with evolving pest organisms. These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of\nvarieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world.\nThe ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related to\n\n--- Page 1404 ---\n1384",

Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from\n15 percent to 40 percent of species destined for extinction by 2050. Scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter\nregional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them, in\nparticular, the endemic species. The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species\nto move with their adapted climate norms while facing habitat gaps along the way. The shifting ranges will impose new\ncompetitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range. One\nsuch unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears. Previously, these two distinct species had separate\nranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable\noffspring, which may or may not be viable crossing back to either parental species.

Researchers\nindicate that more attention to the latter solution is required.\nPreserve Design\nThere has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The fundamental principle behind\nmuch of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson published in 1967 on\nisland biogeography.5This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands. The fundamental conclusion\nwas that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration, speciation, and extinction on that\nisland. Islands farther from a mainland are harder to get to, so migration is lower and the equilibrium number of species is\nlower. Within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually increases to a level similar to the\nnumbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated. In addition, smaller islands are harder to find,\nso their immigration rates for new species are typically lower. Smaller islands are also less geographically diverse so all things\nbeing equal, there are fewer niches to promote speciation. And finally, smaller islands support smaller populations, so the\nprobability of extinction is higher.\nAs islands get larger, the number of species able to colonize the island and find suitable niches on the island increases, although\nthe effect of island area on species numbers is not a direct correlation. Conservation preserves can be seen as \u201cislands\u201d of habitat\nwithin \u201can ocean\u201d of non-habitat. For a species to persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough to support it. The\ncritical size depends, in part, on the home range that is characteristic of the species. A preserve for wolves, which range\nhundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a preserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its\nlifetime. But larger preserves have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support\nmore species, and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily.\nPreserves perform better when there arebuffer zonesaround them of suboptimal habitat. The buffer allows organisms to exit\nthe boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources. One large\npreserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges. For\nthis same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin \u201carms.\u201d If preserves\nmust be smaller, then providingwildlife corridorsbetween them so that individuals (and their genes) can move between the\npreserves, for example along rivers and streams, will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one. All of these\nfactors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.\nIn addition to the physical, biological, and ecological specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of policy, legislative, and\nenforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection of species. These can include\nanything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive human\nrecreation. Many of these policy decisions are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations. In\nsome cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations have been forced from\nancestral lands that fell within a preserve. In other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are\nnot or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction. This\nis a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics.\nLimitations on Preserves\nSome of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. Political and\neconomic pressures typically make preserves smaller, rather than larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult.\nIf the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve. In this case, an\narea on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve.\nEnforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and\nillegal resource extraction.\nClimate change will create inevitable problems with thelocationof preserves. The species within them may migrate to higher\nlatitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable. Scientists are planning for the effects of global warming on future\npreserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to habitats; however, the end\neffectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based.\n5Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson, E. O.,The Theory of Island Biogeography(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1967).\n\n--- Page 1416 ---\n1396",

The measured benefits of dam removal include\nrestoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams is frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which\nleads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality. In the Pacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to\nincrease populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems\nduring its annual spawning migrations. In other regions such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of\nspawninganadromous fish species(species that are born in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh\nwater to spawn). Some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences\nto be measured. The large-scale ecological experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for\nother dam projects slated either for removal or construction.\nThe Role of Captive Breeding\nZoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education. The\ntransformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to\nconservation is ongoing and gaining strength. In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases,\ncaptive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced\nto the wild. However, captive breeding programs have yielded some success stories, such as the American condor reintroduction\nto the Grand Canyon and the reestablishment of the Whooping Crane along the Midwest flyway.\nUnfortunately, zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are\nnow at risk. Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend to\nurbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. A number of studies have been performed\nto look at the effectiveness of zoos on people\u2019s attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results tend to be\nmixed.\n\n--- Page 1418 ---\n1398",
