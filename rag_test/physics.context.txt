Chapter 1: Laws of Motion
Newton’s first law states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. 
Newton’s second law states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied.
Newton’s third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Potential energy is the stored energy of an object due to its position or configuration. 
For example, a ball held at a height has gravitational potential energy.

When two equal and opposite forces act on a body, they form a couple and cause rotation without translation.
